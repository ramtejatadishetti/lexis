This hotel is pet friendly and the dogs that we encountered were really well behaved.

Located right off of Times Square, the location was perfect for dining and the theater. We parked our car and walked all weekend.

We are planning to make this an annual event.

The Muse is our second Kimpton Hotel, the other being the Nine Zero in Boston. I hear so many people say that once they've had the Kimpton experience, they'll seek out Kimptons wherever they go. We're certain to do that ourselves.

Today's online NYTimes has an article about innovations. Here's one they call "The Kindness Hack."

"Researchers at Wharton, Yale and Harvard have figured out how to make employees feel less pressed for time: force them to help others. According to a recent study, giving workers menial tasks or, surprisingly, longer breaks actually leads them to believe that they have less time, while having them write to a sick child, for instance, makes them feel more in control and 'willing to commit to future engagements despite their busy schedules.' The idea is that completing an altruistic task increases your sense of productivity, which in turn boosts your confidence about finishing everything else you need to do."

While 'force' seems antithetic to 'altruistic', it seems to us that The Muse selects for its staff people for whom menial tasks and long breaks aren't what they came for. Everyone we met, from curbside to 9th floor housekeeping, seemed to have that urge to care, eager to go out of their way to make our day a little better, even if just by sharing a smile. More than just hiring for that quality, they're given license to let it show. It does. It can't be faked, of course, nor even taught. It's all natural, in delightfully unpretentious, low-key ways. Good people being themselves. It's very real.

Hotels can't screen guests for altruism. Doubtless The Muse staff serve some difficult or impossible people. It's then more to the staff's credit that they approach all of us as if sure we will be worthwhile. Maybe that ever-fresh optimism makes us try hard not to disappoint them. We enjoyed the lobby wine & social hour with at least five groups in two nights, from near and far, tourists and business people, from teens to senior citizens like ourselves. I'm certain they'd all agree that being at Kimpton brings out the best in us, too.

Who wouldn't go back for more of that?

This hotel is a typical Kimpton classic, and by typical, I only mean good things. I have always been happy with Kimpton hotels. I like their funky decor and good service.

As is very typical of New York hotels, the rooms are small. The hotel should have gone with furniture that fit the room a bit better, but that is the fun of New York hotels. The bed was superior - to the point of I am seriously considering buying their exclusive Sealy mattress.

Service was excellent. The hotel gives a nice happy hour of very average wine. If the wine was a bit better, I would have given this hotel a 'Excellent' rating rather than just 'Very Good'.

As a 'MUST' - check out their lobby bathrooms. Never seen anything like it.

We saw a great deal through SniqueAway and decided to take advantage of it. We went with a King Premier room. This is a beautiful boutique hotel, very close to Times Square. The bell staff and front desk staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. This is a pet-friendly hotel, and there were a couple of nice doggies asleep behind the front desk. In addition, there was a "welcome" bowl of dog food in the front entryway, awaiting some canine guests who were due to arrive. Our room was gorgeous - exactly as pictured on their website, and quite large for a hotel room in New York City. The furnishings are modern, everything very clean, the king bed nice and comfy. The shower was powerful! Really powerful! They had free WiFi in the room, which was a nice plus. There was also the all-important safe for storing valuables that we didn't want to take with us. The only thing missing was a coffee maker, but we requested one, and had one brought to our room within minutes. The hotel location was excellent - just a minute's walk to Times Square. And 2 blocks down W. 46th Street is "Restaurant Row," a wonderful area with a vast variety of restaurants. All in all, a lovely hotel in a great area. Highly recommended.

The room was more than comfortable, the beds were great, and the hotel was so quiet. This is one of my favorite hotels in NYC and I will try to stay here anytime I am back in the city.

When the sofa bed was pulled out, there was no room to walk around. Still, it was what we expected and we had no intention of staying in the room. It was easy to get around. The best part is the proximity to Bryant Park (one of the loveliest in the city).

Breakfast was standard Residence Inn fare. The coffee could have been better.

Our room had a nice view of the Empire State Building. The room was quiet.

The housecleaning staff was nice. One woman found out our girls liked smart food and she brought extras.

The main drawcard for us in staying at Resi Inns is the free wifi and the free breakfast. During the week both worked well on the weekend it all went pear shaped.

We went down to breakfast on the Saturday about 30 mins before closing time and there was no food left. Staff members were actually taking away the empty bins. Staff members stationed at the elevators were less than apologetic when we notified them that there was no food available. It wasn't even closing time!

The elevators are also extremely slow on the weekends. We waited about 20 minutes on the Saturday to get back to our rooms following the horrible breakfast experience.

Surely the hotel has by now noticed the many reviews saying the same thing about the breakfasts. Couldn't you open up a conference room or something with a second buffet on the weekends?

Will we be back? Yes, but only if we are staying during the week.

But, I wouldn't stay here again, due to the fact, the rooms are outdated, small flat screen T.V. The bathroom was horrible, you couldn't closed the door to the bathroom properly, you have to go in and turn around to close the door, not very functional. The hotel should add a modern touch to the rooms, new bedding, carpet, larger television, and maybe brighter paint on the wall.

The Residence Inn located at 6 and 38 is staffed by a very pleasant and help group of employees.
We were there during Memorial Day weekend and they had opened up meeting rooms for the high volume of breakfast crowd. Breakfast was standard sausage rounds, scrambled eggs, pancakes and waffles with all the fixings. Soy milk available on request. Everything kept clean and tables cleared regularly.
Nightly room messages warned us of the elevator traffic between 9-10. We noticed that people on the low teens and down were often faced with full elevators with no ability to board.
The room truly has a weird design. It was big and roomy, but bathroom felt like a closet with a huge door that opened into the cramped space. While there was a mirror outside - it was very dark and not of any real use to alleviate sink traffic. Certainly this is a design flaw and not the fault of the current employees. However, I'm surprised at the recent renovations that didn't consider the needs of two bed visitors.
The rooms were cleaned well. The street sounds were not noticable (we were on floor 28). The fully stocked kitchen was a useful bonus.
The location is within walking distance of Time Square and close to a subway station at Bryant Park. Took us only 12 minutes for a private car to take us to LGA airport on Monday aft. - but I guess traffic was good.
Overall a positive experience.

This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel, first was winter a few years ago and we had another good experience this time as we did then. The location is excellent for tourists, just 5 min from Times square (but far enough away from the crush of people there), 15 min walk from Central Park, one street over from 5th Ave, it certainly puts you close to everything in Midtown. Subways are convenient and we always saw a cab out front. The queen room was a good size and included a couch and coffee table, kitchenette with refrigerator w/ freezer and ice maker, microwave, kitchen sink and plates/glasses/pots/etc, and a counter with 2 stools. Bathroom was small but but nice. Always had hot water on demand, showerhead was not the strongest but got the job done. The bed was comfy, and quite soft (we like a soft bed).

All the staff were very friendly and accommodating. We arrived well before check-in and they held our bags for us and did the same as we checked out before it was time to catch our train. Check-in and check-out was efficient and done with a smile.

As mentioned in other reviews, breakfast was busy, but we had a message left on our phone alerting us that it was a holiday weekend and to expect the breakfast room to be very busy, especially around 9 am. We heeded this advice and got down for breakfast at 8 am both days of our stay and had no line and no problem finding a place to sit. The breakfast selection was very good and the food quality was good too (not gourmet, but not advertised as such). They had a selection of cereals, oatmeal, dried fruits, milk, pastries and other sweet goods, hot foods including sausage patties, scrambled eggs, hash browns, french toast, waffles; whole fruit, cut fruits and yogurts in a salad bar and also bagels, breads, etc. We did hear from others that when they left the breakfast room around 9 am it was completely packed and had a long line. Since it was a holiday, there were a lot of families in the hotel, and my guess is that they were handling many more people than they usually do when they would typically have more business travelers. Someone in another review mentioned the trash was located right next to the plates for the buffet line, just wanted to say that it is on the other side of a wall and doubt it is an issue for most people.

Only real issue was the elevators. One morning after breakfast, we returned to the room and prepared to leave for the day, and we waited 5-10 min for an elevator down from the 8th floor. We ended up just taking the stairs, but if you were higher up this would be a less desirable option. One night we returned around 1030pm and there were about 20 people in line for the elevators. It looked as though only 1 elevator was coming to pick people up. One stayed at the 34th floor (top floor), another at the 18th floor, the third at the 3rd floor. We had to wait for two trips before we could get on the only one running people up from the lobby. I understand the logic of having elevators stationed on the higher floors so people trying to come down don't have to wait for one to come up from the lowest floor, but it still didn't seem to quite work that well. We did hear another guest say one of the elevators may have had an issue, but cannot confirm that to be true.

We felt we got a very good value as we were able to book the room with Marriott points only 3 days before our stay. We would likely stay here again if we come back to New York and the price is right.

Our breakfast can become crowded on the weekends. Elevator delays are common on the weekends as well. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. It seems most guests sit for breakfast around the same time and leave for the day shortly after. We try our best to educate guests on potential crowding so that they can plan accordingly. Its sounds like you saw the worst of it being a holiday weekend.

Overall, it sounds like you enjoyed your stay. I look forward to your future visit.

I visited New York after 13 years again and wanted to stay in a hotel close to all attractions. This hotel is going to be definitely my choice for my next visit to NYC. Here some details.

Room:
As usual in Residence Inn the room comes with a small kitchenette and a huge fridge to keep all your drinks. The room was quite big for a hotel in Manhattan. I liked the bathroom ameneties - usually you find these ones only in saloons. Free wireless internet was very fast!

Breakfast:
BF had a good variety of offer from pancake to croissants. But it was as the hotel was fully booked always crowded.

Location:
Located between the 6th Avenue and 39th street it is the best location. Very close to Times Square and the subway stations it is central to all your destinations in Manhattan.

Car parking:
I mad a mistake and came with a car, the valet parking costs 56$ a day! But I heard that this is usual in New York.

Price:
As I searched for price comparisons in Manhattan and found out that there is no room cheaper than 350$. Therefore the price was ok for Manhattan. If you want to stay cheaper than I recommend to stay in New Jersey that has good bus connections to the city.

I was here for ten days, mostly on business that was spread out around the city. This is one of the smallest Residence Inn rooms I have been in, but it is large for a NY hotel room. My room on the 11th floor had a great view of the Empire State Building, but not all rooms would have that. The positives: 2 minute walk to Bryant Park/42nd street station, about five minutes to Times Square station, Good breakfast, Full sized frig, safe big enough for your laptop, comfy bed. Negatives: the curved rod on the shower made the bathroom even more crowded when the door was opened, during busy tmes you could wait up to 10-15 minutes for elevator, and the night snacks were minimal (had much more of a spread at other Residence Inns), and would have loved a small desk for my laptop instead of the kitchen bar. I stayed on a discounted promo, so I am not sure that I would pay full price for the room; however, I would stay here again if I could have that same rate. The concierge (Judy) was helpful with directions and arranging car pickups. There is a Pret a Manger on the corner across from the hotel for sandwiches and a small market next to the hotel on that side as well. Bryant Park is a great place for a little sunshine (when it is not raining) and it is about a half of a mile to Penn Station and to Grand Central as well.

We had no idea what to expect when we booked this at the last minute to spend a night away. The minute we met Denise, we knew we were going to a wonderful place. Beautiful main house with comfortable and welcoming rooms to sit, relax and enjoy a sip of sherry. Our room was away from the main house and was quiet and beautifully done. Best of all, the breakfast- as my husband said- If breakfast was this good, we have to come back for another night and have dinner! I shouldn't tell you all this because we will never get in again- they'll be all booked!

'A lovely B&B in Lenox - it deserves its' high ratings!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 18, 2012

person found this review helpful

My husband and I spent Mother's Day weekend at this lovely B&B. We've been to Lenox 50 times at least over the years, and never stayed here. But we've stayed at many other Lenox B&B's so I think we have a good sense of comparison. We stayed in Room #1 in the main house. For those not used to old B&B's, this is an OLD house (think 18th c.) so don't expect the W Hotel. Rooms can be funky and ceilings low and bathrooms small. If you understand antique houses, you'll be happier. That being said, the bed was COMFORTABLE - something we never take forgranted anymore and have, in fact, stopped going to several B&B's because they don't understand that charm isn't everything - sleeping is important also! Both the terrific breakfast and the gorgeous grounds make this place heavenly. Walking into town is a delight. The innkeepers are helpful as can be and the chocolate chip cookies are lethal! Try it. You'll like it!

As we approached our 40th wedding anniversary we found the Garden Gables Inn was featured on SniqueAway, TripAdvisor's sister site. After reading the excellent reviews and viewing the photos we thought we found the perfect quick getaway. We were not disappointed. We were greeted at the door by the owner John who gave us a tour of the inn as he led us to our room, #15. The innkeeper, Denise, was on vacation and John stepped in as chef for breakfast which was wonderful. Not only would we love to return, we are purchasing a gift certificate for friends for their anniversary.

'Sweet Stay at the Garden Gables Inn'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed April 12, 2012

people found this review helpful

My husband and I stayed here in February. It's a wonderful inn, and Denise is the best innkeeper. She's friendly and welcoming and at the same time, gives you your space - and to top it off, she's an excellent chef! Because it was a long drive for us, I booked us the 'chef's table' at the Inn for our first night's dinner and I'm so happy I did, dinner was delicious! My husband had to refrain from licking his plate - and the dessert was a perfect sweet ending: homemade lemon pound cake with fresh whipped cream, lemon curd and berries.

I would absolutely stay here again. The only negatives during our stay were:

We stayed in a large room (#15) but the bathroom could use a little sprucing up. I assumed the 'whirlpool' tub would be a large tub but it's just a regular tub with whirlpool jets and the bathroom is so dark, I really didn't feel like soaking. It could use a little renovating.

Also my husband and I booked massages, and (unfortunately I can not remember the name of the man who was our massage therapist) but hands-down the WORST massage either of us has ever had! I get massages often, I was surprised that I wasn't told or asked upon booking if a male masseuse would be okay with me (kinda not) and when I was chatting with him, I asked "how long have you been doing massage" and he said 7 years. There's just no way this guy has been a professional massage therapist for 7 years. He used almost no pressure, even though I kept saying "you can use more pressure"; there was no skill or technique or type of style (swedish, shiatsu, etc) and I kept waiting for him to get started but in the end it was just a really annoying, disappointing experience - waste of time and money. My husband was equally underwhelmed with his massage. So just a head's up.

'Awesome New England Vibe'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed April 3, 2012

It doesn't get more classic New England than this spectacular B&B - a renovated nineteenth century farm with all the modern amenities you could want, on a country road nestled on the side of Lenox mountain and just a 15-minute walk to Tanglewood. The farmhouse is filled with an incredible collection of art, pottery, books and DVDs. While we stayed there this past weekend, a young couple were planning their wedding reception for the fall foliage season. Yes, there's plenty of room to do that in the huge converted barn that also serves as an exhibition space for a variety of talented artists represented by the innkeepers. Our room, the farmhouse and the entire property were perfectly maintained; the bed and pillows were the ultimate in comfort; and the innkeepers Tom and Suky Werman were ideal, low-key yet attentive, hosts. With a comprehensive breakfast selection that includes Tom's special-recipe 'tomlettes', this was flat-out the best B&B we've been to in the region. - Bob & Jane

'Wonderfully different'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed November 1, 2010

We stayed for 2 nights with our 2 children aged 10 and 12. Stonover is utterly wonderful - great location, if you are looking for peace & quiet yet a few minutes' drive from the town, with delightful walks on your doortstep. Traditional on the outside, contemporary/electic on the inside, impeccably clean and delightfully comfortable, with the atmosphere of a home and the style of a boutique hotel. We had Rock Cottage to ourselves - an ideal setup for a family - set slightly above the main house, overlooking the pond with ducks & chickens. The kids loved these and the wild turkeys wandering around - but not as much as they adored Tom & Suky's two Siamese cats! Breakfast was extensive & delicious, with lots of whole grains, granola, fresh fruit and Tom's goat's cheese omelettes, which are truly historic. The early evening tradition of wine & cheese made us feel very welcome, even though we were the only people staying at the time. We were rained in one afternoon and availed ourselves of Tom's huge range of DVDs. We were given plenty of recommendations for walks and nearby restaurants, too. We can highly recommend Stonover Farm to anyone looking for something out of the Berkshires ordinary and, even though it isn't cheap, it is definitely worth it.

'Elegant Historic, Yet Modern B&B With Picturesque Grounds'

person found this review helpful

My husband and I were searching for a relaxing and luxurious place to spend the weekend in the Berkshires near a bit of hiking/walking and found it at Stonover Farm. Unlike other B&Bs, their website is an accurate representation of the grounds and the real thing is even better in person. We stayed at The Cottage and enjoyed every minute of it. Both the Cottage and the main house were very beautifully decorated, clean and well-maintained. The host couple is very pleasant to be around and the wine and cheese and breakfast were nicely done. It may be helpful to note that this review is from the perspective of a 32 year old (as opposed to an antiqueing B&B-goer) and we found that other young professional couples were also enjoying Stonover while we were there, which is a bit unusual in the general world of B&Bs and makes this place all the more wonderful.

We stayed here for 2 nights and it was a great experience. Suki & Tom, the owners, are delightful people.The B&B is quaint and beautifully decorated. We were fortunate to have attended an auction on the property and it was a great experience. We won several items. The ammenities are outstanding. It is a country atmosphere but your are treated like royalty. You will not regret your stay here.
We even had the plaesure of meeting Gene Shalit during our lunch, that was a great surprise.

'Awesome New England Vibe'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed April 3, 2012

It doesn't get more classic New England than this spectacular B&B - a renovated nineteenth century farm with all the modern amenities you could want, on a country road nestled on the side of Lenox mountain and just a 15-minute walk to Tanglewood. The farmhouse is filled with an incredible collection of art, pottery, books and DVDs. While we stayed there this past weekend, a young couple were planning their wedding reception for the fall foliage season. Yes, there's plenty of room to do that in the huge converted barn that also serves as an exhibition space for a variety of talented artists represented by the innkeepers. Our room, the farmhouse and the entire property were perfectly maintained; the bed and pillows were the ultimate in comfort; and the innkeepers Tom and Suky Werman were ideal, low-key yet attentive, hosts. With a comprehensive breakfast selection that includes Tom's special-recipe 'tomlettes', this was flat-out the best B&B we've been to in the region. - Bob & Jane

My husband and I stayed at the DoubleTree Suites in Boston with our 9-month-old and were very happy with our decision and impressed with our room. The location of the hotel is a bit isolated, so I would only stay here if you have a car. We chose this hotel because it was located a quick drive away from downtown, Harvard Square and Tufts University and because it offered rooms with a separate bedroom and sitting area. The room was large, clean and comfortable with a fridge and microwave - all of which made traveling with our infant very easy. The only complaint we had was that there was usually only one person working at the front desk at a time, otherwise staff were very prompt and helpful. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.

Super nice skyline views of Cambridge (the Harvard spires) and Boston, as long as you are on the 8th floor or higher, facing north.

Nice central location if you have a car. Otherwise, it's more than half a mile to Central Square or Harvard Square. Nice short walk to Harvard Business School, but that's about it. Much more activity near the Back Bay Hilton.

Great rooms, large and functional.

'Treated like royalty!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 4, 2012

At first, we were bummed out about staying here. Our son and daughter in law live in the Back Bay and we have stayed at the Hilton near Prudential Center now for nearly 4 years. We always brought our beloved dog, whose last visit was in the fall of '11 before she succumbed to cancer on November 1. The Hilton was literally across the street from their apt.

This past weekend was our first time traveling anywhere with our new dog, a 6 year old beagle whom we rescued in April. I was all set to book the same hotel when I noticed they were no longer dog friendly, apparently due to a new owner. Hence, the not so near Double Tree. ( which we had stayed in many times since 2000 when our sons were enrolled in college nearby)

I called the hotel to request an upgrade based upon our HH diamond status and also because the day we were checking in was going to be our 37th wedding anniversary. I spoke with Wendy who assured me that she would try her best to upgrade our room.

We arrived Friday afternoon and were warmly greeted at the front desk with anniversary wishes and the signature Choco chip cookie. We went to our room and what a treat to find a 2 story dwelling with floor to ceiling windows! There was a half bath downstairs, with a huge wall mounted flat screen tv, of course couches, chairs and table... Microwave, sink and fridge. The sink in the half bath was awesome! See picture.

Upstairs was the bedroom with full bath and a fabulous shower! The best surprise was the tv that was built into the mirror!!

The bedding was plush and there was a great mattress.. There was a railing overlooking the downstairs and views of the Charles River from the multistory windows.

Kudos to Wendy and her warm and sincere staff. All personnel were genuinely cheerful and friendly.

We look forward to staying here again!

'Great for families'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 2, 2012 via mobile

person found this review helpful

The best part of the Doubletree Suites are the large rooms. Spacious and comfortable, especially for families. We have five in our family and are often cramped in hotel rooms. Layout of these suites is a bedroom with two beds and a living room with pull-out couch, kitchen tale, fridge and microwave. The beds were a little small, but still great to have the privacy of a separate bedroom at a regular hotel room price. The pull out couch was surprisingly comfortable, which was usual and nice. Parking was overpriced, but the in-out self-park was convenient, especially since the hotel is not really walking distance to a lot. Convenient to Harvard Business School and parts of Cambridge, but a bit of a hike to Harvard Square or downtown. Convenient to major roadways so easy to get to what you need by car or cab. Not close to the subway though.

All told, I was very happy with the rooms, service and general feel of the hotel. I will be back.

'A bit out of the way'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 1, 2012

In hindsight, it would probably have been better to get accommodation closer to the centre of Boston, but this place was not too bad. Unfortunately for us, one of the reasons for us booking was the pool area for the kids, but this was not open when we were there so it was a bit disappointing. We did enjoy being close to Harvard though. And they also offered a free shuttle to the city so that was good. The atrium was so massive that we got vertigo whenever we were overlooking the balcony... amazing! Rooms were comfortable for family of 4. Breakfast was the best of our etire trip!! I fell in love with Boston on this trip...

We stayed for four nights using our Hilton miles and were happy with the room. The shuttle was a great convenience and we used it several times. We also braved the traffic to cross the bridge into Cambridge and were able to walk to Harvard Square easily. The bed was nice in its own room with a door that could be shut so that the early birds and night owls could sleep uninterrupted. The breakfast was good with hot waffles or oatmeal and breads and fruit. Service was good at the restaurant but we never had dinner there. The rooms were cleaned daily and restocked with coffee and water. The lounge was a bit pricey. We'd stay again.

The hotel is very nice and convenient. They have a shuttle that offers round trip service to many different attractions around Boston and the view to the river is very pleasant, from the rooms that offer it.

My only issue with this hotel was the cleanliness of the room, especially the bathroom. There was hair all over the shower walls and tub. Also, mold was clearly visible. I took pictures and I showed the front desk and they promptly sent housekeeping and they did a thorough job of cleaning the room. The mold was still there but I assume that it would take more than cleaning to get rid of it and we were only there for one night so we just accepted it for lack of a better term.

I gave the rating as "Very Good" because the staff was extremely responsive and pleasant. Also, the hotel really is nice. While it was a bit of a downer that the room was not cleaned properly and that mold was visible in the bathroom the staff responded in a fast and friendly manner.

If you are in Boston, consider this hotel. Sometimes the difference between a good and bad review is how the staff handle "stumbles" in a guest's experience at a hotel. This hotel did its job.

Started off great with very friendly front desk staff and a warm cookie. In dining food and service were really good, but struggling with the fact that they charge $12.95 a day for internet...PER DEVICE. Everything else was basically fine...room cleanliness and comfort, location, price, service, noise levels, etc. I just think that's really tacky to charge for internet by device. I travel quite a bit and most hotels no longer even charge, let alone by device. So if you are working on your laptop during the day, then jump on your iPad to read or game in the evenings....$25. Cha Ching. Oh, and it's $40 to park.

I stumbled onto this hotel because I had business at Harvard and stumbled upon an excellent rate through AAA. From the number of other guests milling about, I guess I wasn't the only one who discovered it. My room was just excellent. Roomy, modern, nice amenities, comfortable bed, and, not surprisingly for a suite hotel, a frig and microwave. Bonus, a cool view of Harvard past the Charles. You have to drive just a little to get into Boston. But the hotel sits right on Soldier's Field Road (which runs into Storrow). So, if traffic's OK, you can easily access anything in the city, but be out of the center of it.

We realized at about 5 p.m. that we wouldn't make it to the hotel by 9 p.m. so called to let them know. The owner was very gracious and informed us that it wouldn't be any problem to get there late. When we arrived, he helped us with out bags, showed us our room and made sure we were all set. Because we had to leave before breakfast would be ready, he left a note with the kitchen asking them to have some coffee and muffins ready for us early, which they did. The rooms were clean, New England B&B cute, and the beds comfortable. All in all a great experience and I would highly recommend this hotel!

'An Amazing B&B Experience'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed April 14, 2012
1
person found this review helpful

Where to begin? The Cornell in Lenox is quite possibly one of the most unique and amazing experiences. When I travel I prefer to stay in B&B's and the Cornell far suprasses all. Let's start with the food. Lance (their head chef) is utterly incredible. His culinary pairings are of the utmost quality. Lance has an understanding of food that is just beyond my comprehension; his scalloped potatoes make the Iron Chef look bad. Lance has a passion for food and it is absolutely reflected in his servings. If you have the opportunity to stay for brunch, you would be missing out if you didn't experience it. Then there is Judith. Judith is the primary innkeeper at this point in time, and she is incredible. She's kind, she's caring and most importantly, she just wants you to have a good time. Any good inkeeper is one who cares about the quality of your stay, and Judith wants to make sure your stay is fabulous. I haven't even mentioned the rooms (that's probably because I think they speak for themselves), so quanit, so clean, so outstandingly beautiful. Colleen and her crew absolutely enhance the rustic ambiance of this mangical Inn. The Cornell has an amazingly antique charm. Upon walking in you just feel welcomed. Time seems to just slow down and you're suddenly able to stop and smell the roses. Personally, I fell inlove with The Cornell from the moment I walked in. Its an experience I would recommend for anyone.

We stayed for the weekend in the Frances Room which is big, comfortable and has a nice fireplace. Lance made a delicious breakfast and had helpful tips on where to go for a hike (Kennedy Park which is 2 minutes away from the hotel) and restaurants to try. We would definitely visit again.

'Amazing Dinner by Chef Lance!!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed January 22, 2012

We spent New Years Eve at the Cornell this past year and can not say enough about this place and it's staff! The staff made us feel very much at home and happily answered our questions about the Inn and surounding area. Our room was very clean with such a beautiful bed and fireplace. The Location could not be better, just a 5 minute walk into the very cute village of Lenox, where there are lots of great shops and restaurants. But!, we decided to eat dinner Saturday night at the Cornell, and let me tell you it was the best meal we've ever had!! The duck was perfectly done with a sauce that was out of this world, butternut bisque (amazing!) popovers, prime rib, risotto, potatoes, and vegetables (FIVE STARS!), bourbon pecan pie and raspberry cheesecake, (heaven!!!) we can't wait to go back, and are thinking of having a family reunion there! Did I mention the breakfast?! Hats off to the chef! Thank you!

'Wonderful Stay at the Cornell'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed October 21, 2011

My wife and I stayed at the Cornell this past weekend and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We were celebrating our 5th anniversary and our visit was relaxing and memorable. I'll say right off that my wife and I are not finicky/fussy. On the other hand, we are not indiscriminating in our expectatiions. I was more impressed by the hospitality at the Cornell than some $300+ hotels I've stayed at. My wife's mother ran a B+B for more than 10 years and recognizes good service. In part, I am writing this review to offset a poor review that I read with disbelief. I honestly feel that 4 stars is a fair appraisal.

I like Victorian style homes and found the rooms beautiful and clean. The inn was not fully occupied so Lance offered us a choice of several rooms. We upgraded to a room called "Dolly" at no extra cost. The decore was spendid with period furniture and tasteful floral wallpaper. We loved the antique touches in the room such as lamps in the style of the early 20th century and depression era glassware. The complementary coffee mugs we received were a pleasant surprise. After dinner we took advantage of the cozy bar which had a variety of tablegames. The fourposter bed was comfortable and we slept well.

The next morning the breakfast included a delicious egg/potato/herb casserole, homebaked cinnamon rolls, fresh fruit, coffee and juice. We had a lively conversation with the staff and then walked about the property. The Cornell has a lovely Koi pond, a patio with umbrellas, and a wooden swing on the lawn. The main house has an inviting porch with rocking chairs. Afterwards, we had a great hike in Kennedy Park which was within walking distance from the B+B.

I will mention some things which could use a little attention. The house could use painting. Some yard items could be spruced up. My wife and I have renovated our house which dates back to the 1840's and believe that things don't need to be perfect to be appreciated. Overall, I felt the friendly staff attended to our needs and gave us a wonderful stay. We'd gladly stay at the Cornell again.

My husband and I spent a lovely weekend at the Village Inn. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Our room was very spacious with rustic charm, and included both a fireplace and a whirlpool tub. The Inn is within walking distance to shopping in town, perfect for a nice walk before dinner. We spent the evening at Rumpy's Tavern for Karaoke night. The atmosphere was very lively with a nice mix of both locals and visitors to the Inn. The breakfast included in the stay was much more than I expected. Such a nice spread of both hot and cold options including gingerbread pancakes which were delicious. I would recommend the Inn to anyone looking for a relaxing weekend.

The Village Inn was highly recommended to me by friends at work, and I was not disappointed. It was a wonderful weekend get-away to meet friends and get out of the city. It started with the scenic drive up the Taconic Parkway. Driving through Lenox was like walking in the past, such history but yet they still kept up with the times. When I arrived at the Inn I felt like I was family, the warm welcome was matched by the excellent service and many answered questions about the area. The Inn is in walking distance to the many shops in town. The room had a lovely historic charm to it, very clean and I loved the antiques. Once I settled into my room, I went to Rumpy's Tavern, which is within the Inn, to see if the rest of our group arrived. We had pre-dinner drinks and found the bartender most friendly, he serves an excellent martini. We then went upstairs to Rumplestiltzkin's for dinner. The dinner was superb and the service excellent. We were told this was one of the best restaurants in the Lenox area, if not the best. We were not disappointed. After dinner we all went back to Rumpy's Tavern to have after dinner drinks and to our delight it was karaoke night! A good mixture of tourist and local patrons, it was a perfect ending to a perfect day. The next morning we were served a wonderful breakfast. If you are in the Lenox area this Inn is a must!

This lovely colonial style Inn provided good nold New England atmosphere and excellent service. From the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted with a smile and an interest in making you stay a pleasant one. The rooms are very comfortable and clean, and decorated with a lovely mix of antique furniture. What a treat to find the bathroom had a whirlpool tub, a great way to unwind and/or start the day.
The Inn has a great Restaurant, we had dinner and I must say that the Pork Osso Bucco was fabulous, as was the rest of the meal. Breakfast is included with the stay and I was impressed by the lovely buffet.
We had a great time in the Tavern - Rumpys, definite rustic charm and a fun group of patrons (guests at the Inn as well as some local regulars).
The Inn is walking distance to downtown and a variety of stores. There is parking available on sire for guests - this is a definite plus for a B&B.
I would definite recommend the Inn as a great get away - I am looking forward to returning in the Fall to enjoy the change of season in this charming and welcoming B&B

I cannot say enough about the service we received. Everyone that works there is absolutely wonderful, very friendly, helpful, and attend to your every need. The suite we stayed in had two bedrooms kids stayed in one and me and my wife the other. There was a fridge, sink, stove, dining table etc it had more of a home feeling than a hotel or Inn. The food is probably the best in that area. The bar was very nice, music, bartender all work together to make everyone feel comfortable. The place was very clean enough towels, blankets, and sort of a throwback design with antique wood furniture. Highly recommended.

My girlfriend and I booked a room looking for a quiet weekend together. I spoke with Jen when I reserved the room and had a brief conversation with her about things to do in the area and that we were looking for a quiet weekend. I would like to personally thank Jen for making sure we got what we wanted. On arrival We had are room upgraded, although this was during the off season I thought the gesture was real nice. The rooms are not exactly upscale, but thats not what we were looking for and I feel they are worth the price. They were clean w/wirlpool baths which was a nice touch. Breakfast was included, and I have to say the food was excellent. We ate here both mornings and both of us had different items each day. The second night of our stay we had dinner at their restaraunt, Jen sat us in the most private area of the restaraunt, I like the fact she remembered me saying we were looking for a quiet weekend on the phone. Again the food was outstanding the appetizers and both our main courses were outstanding and generous in portion. Thanks again Jen for adding a personal touch to ensure we enjoyed our stay. If your looking for an economical place close to town (walking), with great service and great food stay at the Village Inn.

We have to say we were outright delighted with this place, where we spent a weekend three hours north of New York City for a second time. It is small and intimate, located in the oldest building in the village, dating back to the late 1700s. It has comfortable and atmospheric rooms with some antique furniture. It is more rustic than lavish - the room still has a VCR! - but that is the charm. But our room still had 4mb/s wifi (although not all rooms do). It is located within walking distance of dozens of other shops and cafes on the main street. And one of its main advantages is its in-house restaurant, Rumpelstiltzkins, which produces extremely good food, New England Traditional with a French/italian spin, at very attractive prices. So you don't even have to go out, but if you do, there are dozens of interesting museums and restaurants and other attractions in the surrounding area (try the nearby bookstore which serves wine in the evenings). At some times of year they offer a $50 voucher for the restaurant with the room, which we got. And it all meant we felt we got extremely good value for an atmospheric and comfortable stay.

Where to begin? The fact that the rooms are small, and I had one of the better ones, not charming or quaint ambience at all like any normal B&B, in Lenox or elsewhere in our experience, totally out of date, linoleum floor and moldy bathroom and tub, dirty, smelly, all in all like my old college fraternity house and room that my parents took one look at and almost had a heart attack. A great location in the middle of Lenox does not come even remotely close to makeup for all the really unpleasant things about this place's public areas and rooms. We could not wait to leave. Cannot begin to understand how anyone would rate this as anything but a loser. Certainly makes one wonder. Tip to owners......spend a little on maintenance and improvements every now and then.

The food was fine - nothing special but the innkeeper is terrific at accommodating food sensitivities. All around good experience and value for the price.

While there check out Shakespeare & Company and stop by Spoons for a light lunch and a terrific bowl of homemade organic ice cream!

This is the only place we stay at in the Berkshires, even if it is further than others! We've gone here since 2006, and have visited at least half a dozen times. We've even gone back with our toddler, for whom they set up a port-a-crib, gave her her own breakfast, had a high chair for her use, and just treated her like a princess. They are always very understanding of my vegetarian diet, and always make sure that I get something delectable to eat! And they always make sure the coffee is fresh! My husband went to change a diaper, and by the time he came back, they'd decided his coffee was too cold, so promptly served him a new one. The staff are incredibly kind and generous and approachable, the innkeeper Amy knows EVERYTHING about ANYTHING in the area and is an amazing resource for planning any type of vacation in the area, be it romantic, family or otherwise! We are definitely going back in the Spring. See you there ;)

We are truly surprised and puzzled by this review. As you can see in other reviews, most of our guests comment positively on their experience at the inn and how friendly and helpful we and our staff are. As innkeepers who take great pride in our inn we deeply regret that this guest had an unpleasant experience. Neither my employees nor I would ever refuse to give a child water. That's absurd. We pride ourselves on being child friendly and enjoy our guests' children. As a mater of fact, we remember oohing and coo-ing with her child. Our food is fresh and in this guest's instance, she had a special diet and we made every effort to meet her dietary requests on a daily basis. I believe that due to her pregnancy, her taste buds may have been 'off.' Our other guests seemed to enjoy our breakfast selections. We sincerely apologize that she did not enjoy her experience here.

After a stay in a rustic B&B in Vermont, the Rookwood Inn appeared to us both luxurious and entirely welcoming. Amy, the innkeeper, greeted us as if we were her most valuable guests and was a font of wisdom regarding local and area places in which to eat, swim, and hike. Our room was beautifully coordinated and entirely comfortable with Eastlake antiques predominating. Breakfast was well-prepared, but the secret delight of the place lies in the screened-in side porch where morning coffee and evening drinks can be taken along with the cool Berkshire air. Lennox and its many attraction is just a block away, but the ambience of Rookwoord is rural peacefulness. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.

'Our first experience with a B&B and it could not have been better'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed August 23, 2011

The location can't be beat; Lenox is in the middle of the Berkshires, and this inn is steps away from the shopping, restaurants, and Shakespeare & Company is walkable. I learned the hard way last year that the decent accommodations in or near Lenox are relatively pricey, but the Rookwood looks after its guests. I have new health issues, and felt completely taken care of, from the inn's very generously portioned, balanced breakfasts to the helpful binder of menus from area restaurants (I could check if there were things I could eat-- and we could plan costs). If you're gluten free or dairy free, or have other health issues, the Rookwood will look after you: they'll serve you completely safe versions of the foods everyone else is eating (e.g. very tasty waffles, french toast, parfaits and omelettes). PS the sausages are also delicious.

We had a chance to peek in all the guest rooms over the course of our stay (when empty, they are left open), and can say that they look exactly like the online photos and descriptions. My favourites online were my favourites in-person. We needed a room that was quiet, and while you could hear voices in the hall a bit, once people were in their rooms you could not hear a thing-- it was like you were the only people in the inn. The air conditioning was effective, and it was great having our own a/c (and heat) controls. We stayed in the "Tavern" room; it was small, but there was ample room for both our suitcases and also new purchases, and to sit & check email-- and there's so much to do in the area, we were barely there. As for the common rooms, we particularly enjoyed spending some late (and rainy) afternoons on the screened porch off the salon, sipping tea, enjoying the snack, staring at the trees and talking.

The only quibbles were minor, and with the quality of the accommodations and food would not matter to most people. The water pressure in the shower was weak (third floor of an old building) but even with my long hair it wasn't a problem at all. We weren't used to springy type beds, but slept well after we quickly adjusted to it. I'm only mentioning these two things in case someone's picky-- and to show this is a real review. No place is perfect-- even home has its quirks!

Lastly, the innkeeper Amy was just lovely, as was her cook. We really enjoyed spending time talking with them. That wasn't only our impression-- while we were in town, in store after store, when they heard where we were staying, they commented on how nice Amy is. We agree! And while sitting in the inn's salon, we found that even several of the other guests were nice, too.

It's not just good food, nice rooms and wonderful innkeepers that tempt people to come back-- the Rookwood is very professionally run, with an efficient registration system online, prompt replies to email queries, a good system for late arrivals, that menu binder, free wifi, parking right near the entrance to the inn, two luggage racks in the room, the well-gravelled (and thus minimal puddles and mud) parking lot, and other details. It's a small facility but I know a few big-name hotels that could learn some lessons from them.

Bottom line: if you're looking for commercial accommodations in the Berkshires, I highly recommend staying at the Rookwood. We definitely hope to return!

'Our fifth visit, still an excellent base for a cultural stay in the Berkshires'

Accomodating staff, pleasant Victorian-style rooms (but thankfully not overly fussy), excellent breakfast fare, remarkably quiet for center of town location.

'Overpriced!'

We have stayed in the Berkshires many times usually staying at the Red Lion Inn, While that hotel is not top notch I believe that you get what you pay for there. The same cannot be said for The Rockwood Inn. My husband and I thought that it was incredibly expensive for what you got .... the smallest of bathrooms, a pull out bed (for our little boy) that even made an 8-year old sore, master bed that needs to be replaced, and extremely poor lighting. It served our purpose of a place to stay but we hated paying the price of a villa in St. Barths for a 5-day stay. We will not be back.

'Customer service not great'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed June 5, 2012

I booked a last minute 2 night stay at the Apple Tree Inn in order to attend a seminar at Kripalu. There was no lodging space available at Kripalu and the proximity of this inn made it a good second choice. Unfortunately the speaker I wanted to see cancelled the seminar 2 days before the scheduled start date. Kripalu refunded my fee entirely. The owner of Apple Tree was not as gracious. Even though my reservation at her Inn had been booked for less than 36 hours, she kept $25 of my deposit as a cancellation fee and will keep the remainder ($55) to be used only as a credit towards a future stay. So this will essentially be a waste of $80 as I am unlikely to stay there for any reason other than a Kripalu seminar and would normally try to stay on-site at Kripalu. This reservation was unusual due to the last minute booking.
As a CPA I can understand that the owner's business was negatively impacted by this cancellation, however, I believe the negative goodwill associated with this charge far outweighs the short term business loss. I feel as if I was charged $80 to have a reservation for 36 hr plus the disappointment of my seminar cancellation. The Inn owner is the only one that benefited from the cancellation and she didnt even have the courtesy to contact me directly. Instead I could only talk to a manager or via email. I consider this poor customer service and will stay at Kripalu or Ironwood Inn for my next seminar.

'Egg-eaters pay for their own.'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed February 24, 2012

people found this review helpful

We stayed here for one night prior to a stay at Kripalu, extending our retreat while adding only moderate expense. The inn is a bit slapdash and the service haphazard, but in all it's much more atmospheric and spacious than Kripalu's dorm-like rooms. The cold buffet breakfast was tasty, and while one might resent paying extra for hot food, I appreciated that this was a way to keep room charges down by not subsidizing egg-eaters. We were in the main house (at the suggestion of another reviewer, who warned against the mildewy lodge), Room #15, which is on the 3rd floor. How wise it was to add a skylight to the slanted eaves, which might otherwise have felt claustrophobic! Charming floral decor without becoming cloying.

Here's why I don't give it an excellent rating: First, there was no porch light on, making for a precarious entry to the place (although allowing us to enjoy the velvet darkness and glittering stars of the Berkshire winter). Second, there was no recommendation for a dinner spot in Lenox. Third, we got up for the 8 am breakfast we were told would await us, only to be told that it would start at 9, and then later this was retracted but it started at 9 anyway. Fourth, when we asked for green tea bags we were told that there weren't any, but after we drank our distant second favorite, green tea was produced. So you see why I say slapdash and haphazard.

Nonetheless, it might be nice to try the place for a day or two in the summer to use the pool and walk over to Tanglewood. The location can't be beat.

'Good lodging option if you're visiting Kripalu'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed January 6, 2012

I stayed here while visiting the nearby Kripalu Yoga Center. This is a great option if you're getting a daypass and don't qualify for lodging at Kripalu or if you're coming with friends/a partner and want a cheaper and MUCH nicer housing option than Kripalu offers.

It is definitely less convenient than staying at Kripalu itself since it's a good 10 minute walk so you can't just run back to your room to get something. On the other hand, during off-peak times you're paying much less for the accommodations by staying at the Apple Tree Inn and you're getting a way better place to stay. Kripalu doesn't have air conditioning, a pool, or super comfy beds, but the Apple Tree Inn has all of the above. The walking path is not that well lit so if you're staying here in the winter when it gets dark early I'd recommend driving the short distance between the two locations instead of walking back in the dark.

I had my wedding at the Apple Tree on 11/2011 and just have to say what a wonderful experience it was.My Husband and I were very happy we chose the Apple Tree as our wedding location. They were extremely accomodating to us & to all of our guests, who had nothing but great comments about the Inn. We were fortunate to have had warm weather to be able to have our ceremony out on the patio with the beautiful view before us as the sun set. From the rooms, the food, the staff the entire weekend went without a hitch. The grounds are beautiful and inspiring. The rooms were great & cozy. I will definitely visit again & I suspect many of our guests will return as well.

I stayed at the Apple Tree Inn in 11/2011 while attending a seminar at Kripalu. The best part was the landscape, fruit ladde trees, and overall cleanliness of the inn. The host and other attendants were very professional, sweet and kind. I got a room at the lodge that I did not care for and was relocated to the main building which has lovely rooms with very victorian style and comfortable beds. The inn serves breakfast which is in its dining room. Beautiful settings and very sunny rooms. In the morning the lobby and dining areas are bathed with warm sunlight. A definite place to revisit. The rates were decent. I will definitey stay here on my future trips to Kripalu and would highly recommend other nature enthusiasts as well as vacationers to pick this spot.

There are some nice restaurants in the vicinity and lovely walking landscape if you are into exercising.

Fresh air and lovely landscape.

'Views, Ambiance, Great Owners - What's Not to Like!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed November 14, 2011

This was our second stay at the Apple Tree Inn and it was as great this time as last year! The owners went out of their way for us, giving helpful advice and directions on places to visit. The inn is beautifully furnished - there is always coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc. waiting for those who want it, lending to the relaxed atmosphere. The breakfast was ample and leisurely with no one rushing us out. The views from the inn are incredible overlooking a lake and nearby Tanglewood. Our room was spotless and quiet and the shower worked very well. While there is no television, we can honestly say it was never missed. We heartily recommend this inn.

'Nice inn but a few glitches'

people found this review helpful

The rooms in the main Inn are comfortable and the Inn is very clean. The wood fire in the living room is wonderful on a cold day. The antiques are lovely. The inn was close to Kripalu so you can do a day rate there. It snowed when we were there and staff were kind enough to help us clean the car. The inn appealed to women over 40.

Now for the glitches. There is no one at the Inn after 11:00 pm, so if something goes wrong you are on your own. We had a smoke alarm going off in our room at night because of a low battery. There was no one around to help us. We called the owners but the alarm did not go off until 6 am when the maintainence staff arrived. We did not sleep all night and were not compensated in any way. Not great for business. For this reason we would not be back.

'Peace and quiet'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed September 27, 2011

Imagine waking up in the morning and hear birds singing instead of coughing, green fields in all directions instead of smog and traffic jams, no tv (except in the suites), no telephones and cell./mobile phones are not allowed in the Lounge..plus FRESH AIR for FREE!!!. Then imagine The Apple Tree Inn near Lenox in Mass. USA

The Bar is very atmospheric - typical late 1800's New England 'Pub' atmosphere (very good selection of Scotch Whiskies - blended and Malt) and a building with history going back to that time period.

A 20 minute walk (leave the car) from a music festival area - Tanglewood which is - among other things home to many world famous Boston Orchestras and Jazz Festivals - (but no sound at the Inn from the area)

My son and I flew from Scotland on vacation and we stayed at Apple Tree Inn to go to - among other things - the Tangelwood Jazz Festival (excellent)...The Inn is owned by Sharon and Joel and they have kept many late 19th century character fixtures and fittings and also created a very warm and friendly atmosphere from all the staff..Is like visiting friends rather than vacation...Breakfast is light - but cooked breakfast is available - and Dinner is excellent value..There is a pool but the scenery and peace and quiet is priceless..Far from the Madding Crowd is definitely the words to use

You can't get closer to Tanglewood and the views are great. But if you are staying in the lodge, you better REALLY love the location. It's expensive and hot breakfast costs extra. Staff was fine. The big problem is the relentless mildew smell in the lodge. The innkeeper called it "sporadic"? Puleeze!

'Musty and shabby'

Maybe the people who have written glowing reviews of Walker House had the only decent rooms in the place. There is a vast difference between eclectic decor and cluttered mess, between worn and downright dirty, between charming and decrepit, between basic and spartan, and between aged and ramshackle. The Walker House misses on all counts. We only saw our hostess Peggy, a few fellow guests, and several cats. Never saw Richard. Our rooms were musty, dark and decorated with a mix of (interesting) opera memorabilia and worn-out junk. The lamps were too dim to see anything at all and the wallpaper had come almost completely away from the wall. The smell of mildew was overwhelming. The bath shared by our two rooms had a dirty fiberglass shower and tub insert with a showerhead meant for a munchkin. The linens looked as though they had come from a yard sale; they were mismatched and tattered. Admittedly, there was a large and attractive veranda across the back of the house, onto which our rooms opened. However, the floor was dangerously weak at points, the furniture was literally falling apart, and the garage off the back leaned to one side and had a huge hole in the roof. A strong wind might have knocked it down by now. We are early risers, but no one even started a pot of coffee before 8:30. Breakfast, never ready before 9, was cold cereal and maybe some fruit or a few pastries. It was very disapponting, not at all like the descriptions we had read, and grossly overpriced. Location was the only positive for this place. It is within walking distance of Lenox shops and restaurants, and a short, easy and uncongested drive to the secondary parking lot at Tanglewood.

I've been coming to Walker House for the past 12 years, and every time I step through the door, I instantly feel at home. Large fireplaces, wide porches, piles of books and friendly cats all contribute to a truly relaxing atmosphere. The rooms are spacious and decorated with antiques, in keeping with the history of the house. The inn is also walking distance to the shops and restaurants in downtown Lenox. Owners Peggy and Dick are warm, friendly hosts, and have their fingers on the pulse of the local arts scene. All in all, a great place to stay for the perfect Berkshire experience!

5 of 5 stars Reviewed December 14, 2010

My husband & I head over to Lenox to attend the excellent concerts at Tanglewood in addition to local museums and just to wander the villages and take in historic Lenox.

Walker House is the perfect Inn to come home to after our days forays. Each of the rooms is named after a different composer and designed in period (the innkeepers obviously know their stuff). One finds lovely canopy beds, working fireplaces and huge bathtubs in the rooms.

The public areas are fun to relax in and explore, full of books and charming nick nacks. In addition, the innkeepers offer a huge video screen on which to watch a variety of dvds.

We love that Walker House is pet friendly - with several cuddly cats wandering through. We don't travel with pets, but have our own at home, so we appreciate the furry friends!

The Innkeepers, Peggy and Dick, are very helpful and pleasant, whether they are providing a lovely breakfast in their dining room or talking about the area that they so obviously love.

Overall, Walker House is wonderful all year round - an enhancement to a stay in the Berkshires or perhaps even a reason to plan a trip there!

We stayed at the Walker House for 3 nights. Peggy, the owner, was warm, friendly and very hospitable. We chose the Walker House for its location and because it allowed dogs. On seeing the room we were mildly disappointed. There was a hole in the ceiling in the bathroom from a prior leak and the doorknob on the closet hung. The first night to say that the bed creaked doesn't do it justice. It was loud every time either of us moved. It was also
very uncomfortable - so much so that we considered leaving the next morning. We stayed

Miriam in the Bistro always had a smile in the morning (a rare commodity these days) and Jimmy at the valet station was eager to please. The room was super clean, the valet was completely efficient and it was located adequately close to the 10 and the 405.

The room was on the small side, but being alone it did not bother me in the least. Had I been with my family, it would have been cramped. There were no signs of renovations and my room felt up-to-date, so perhaps it was done already.

The only negatives are the cost of parking, which was $54 for three days and somewhat limited options at the Bistro.

I will use this hotel again on future trips to LA

Thank you for the high marks and I am glad to be able to personally recognize and couple of staff members. It is with great pride when a staff member is personally mentioned in a review. Regarding the guest room you the rooms very last done in 2004-5 so I am glad you have mentioned that you were satisfied. The staff/team works hard to maintain the quality of the rooms even though they are close to 8 years old. A renovation is soon planned, too.

Again thank you for your valuable comments.

Kind Regards,

Everyone knew my name and seemed genuinely interested in whether our stay was going well. None of this felt fake or forced -- it seemed sincere in every case. Little touches like fruit water in the lobby added to the experience. Good location, close to a lot but not so close as to be noisy. We were in a stressful situation -- a two-day job tryout for my son -- a bad hotel stay would have increased the stress but instead it minimized it. Thanks so much!

The "Bistro" on the second level, which boasts a very European flair, is a great place to get a quick coffee,excellent breakfast, or a light meal. This hotel is truly a delightful "oasis" in the heart of the city, and we would definitely stay there again.

The room was large and very spacious. Not sure if this was a normal size room or not, but I was not about to complain.
Although I have been to LA many times, this was my first time driving in LA. The hotel was easy to find and fairly easy access to the highway. I would stay here again.

Even with the relative high price per night, service is up to par for it. James is a fantastic manager there who will remember you, as does Joy, who works the front desk. Valet parking always bothers me, but that's pretty much the norm around here.

'Charming, Comfortable, Close to Tanglewood'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed April 30, 2012

Located in the Berkshire mountains just a mile from Tanglewood, Whistlers Inn is a special treat for travelers looking for charming, historic ambiance and warm, welcoming service. The public rooms are stunning and decorated in period antiques. Porches surround the first floor on two sides and overlook the garden. A Steinway piano graces the parlor, and a wine decanter and glasses awaited guests when I arrived on a Friday evening. Lisa Mears, the inn manager and daughter of author Richard Mears and his artist wife Joan, greeted me at the door and gave me a quick tour of the house. My room was cozy with a private bath and a comfortable bed. The full breakfast was served in the spacious dining room; it was more than ample and guests were offered a choice of hot, freshly cooked breakfast entrees as well as fruit and juice, a large selection of pastries, and coffee and tea. Guests lingered after the meal to hear Richard's stories about the house and to watch a brief screening of the Travel Channel episode that was shot at the inn. Lisa directed me to the many literary and artistic sights in the area and made suggestions based on my interests. This trip I was traveling on business; I'll be back, next time with my husband and more free time to sightsee!

'Home Sweet Home'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed February 18, 2012

Well, it was a dark and snowy night, in the middle of a winter storm, in the middle of winter and we landed, all according to plan at the hidden entrance gothic, gingerbread storybook world of Whistler's Inn. After ringing, ringing, ringing and no one coming, we simply pushed the door easily open and let ourselves in. Deep caramels, crimson and indigo lights of treasured objects everywhere, crystal chandeliers, marble, dark wooden beams and book lined walls, scent of cedar, balsam and sage, wafting around us in the warmth, fusing shapes, colors and old world dimensions altogether embracing our senses. Still no one else but us to meet. We were so happy already and grateful to be there.

We readily unfurled the layers of winter coats off us, put our bags aside and proceded to peer through the collection of mysteries around us. We ventured unescorted, our imagination captured, through the secret victorian rooms and recesses with abandon. What pure delight we felt and so welcomed with the discovery of the hot herbal tea, digestifs and fresh baked pastries we noticed awaiting us in the dining room. Naturally, we just poured our tea, grabbed some sweets and plunked down into one or another of the overstuffed chairs to sit and gaze around us. That was happiness.

Moments later, a beautiful, young blond woman appeared soundlessly through the swinging kitchen door. With a wry and welcoming smile, she said softly, "Hi, do you have your room yet?" Well, she then produced a heavy key for some room upstairs, as I recall.

After thawing out from the cold and being sweetly entertained with music and her mellow, enquiring conversation, we retreated for the night. Our room was a darling,cozy, wallpapered refuge `

That was Lisa.That was twenty years ago.

She and her parents, Richard and Joan, all artists, have since become life long friends and their magical world, a yearly necessity.

'A bit right of center'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed October 13, 2011

The owner went a bit overboard with what I'll politely call his "right of center social views." If that's not your thing, you might have a hard time at the Whistler's Inn. The breakfast was warm and generous in a lovely room, the bedroom however was on the cold side. The interior is old, when was the last time money was spent on maintenance or renovations? I suppose it's charming to have a toilet seat as old as the house - the large square footage and coffee maker in the hallway were nice. Sorry to say, but I'll look for a different B&B next time I'm in the area.

'Wonderful Stay in Berkshire Inn'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed September 24, 2011

We wanted to stay in an Inn in the Berkshires and we are certainly glad we found Whistler's Inn in one of our searches. It is in a good location in the historic town of Lenox, Mass; well situated for exploring the Berkshires. Our hostess was wonderful during our stay. She was friendly and helpful about good restaurants in the area and helped out when we had difficulty with the WIFI. You could tell she truly enjoyed meeting and talking with her guests. Our room (The Hunt Room) was comfortable and large. Everything was clean, although some signs of age are showing (not a bad thing in an Inn with character). There was a library, sitting room and sun room  I will attach pictures. We certainly had the feeling that we were welcome to use any of these rooms. We walked down the hill to the business section of Lenox and had supper outside. It is not far and a comfortable walk (evening walking back up the hill). Breakfast in the dining room was delightful  french toast made fresh with lots of other goodies to enjoy. The grounds are beautiful and I wish I had taken more time to spend in the garden.

We stayed in the "Africa Room". The toilet didn't flush properly, the bed was hard as a rock, the ceilings fans swayed so much and made so much noise we had to turn them off, the swivel chair in the room was broken. The buffet breakfast included hostess donuts, store bought mini muffins, bagels and croissants and a few other items. The pitcher of milk at our table was so far gone that it had a thick ,chunky consistency. Felt like inn keeping was an afterthought. Worst place I have ever stayed.

'Absolutely wonderful!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed August 25, 2011

My two traveling buddies and I were on a ghost tour of New England and decided to stay at the Whistler's Inn due to its history and location. It couldn't have been a more enjoyable time. We stayed in the Santa Fe room which was spacious and comfortable. Sitting for hours in the library reading (the sherry was a nice touch) and the music room was so relaxing. The host, Lisa, is simply enchanting with so many fascinating experiences around the world. Her company alone is worth the visit. The owner, Richard is a author of note and a fascinating guy to talk to over breakfast (which was so much better than previous reviews prepared me for).

As for haunted, I expected to only go to a place that OTHERS claimed was haunted, but ending up having a bit of an experience myself. Don't worry if this is not what you are looking for, however. In my experience, you really only see things if you are looking for them (other families were there, and none of their kids look petrified).

All in all, I can't imagine having picked a better place.

It was so nice to wake up in the early morning to hear nature calling and taking an early
morning walk. Enjoyed all the delicious meals and visiting with people from all over the
world. There is so much history in Lenox and many sites to visit. It is nice to be able to
walk to these near by sites and find the town itself very enchanting. The atmosphere is
very relaxing and one can imagine what it was like in the 1800's. The music room is
beautiful and the flowers and grounds surrounding the Inn is lovely. Whistler's Inn takes
you a step back in time and you can only wonder what it was like many years ago. Enjoyed the library and having a sip of sherry while visiting with guests. Loved every moment of our visit. I am ready to return soon.

'disappointing'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed July 9, 2011

We knew that we had booked a small room in this b&b and were happy to have a private bath since I am pregnant, but the overall condition of the room and the entire interior was somewhat shabby. And small did not even cover it- the room was about 8 feet by 12 feet. The bathroom was also so small, you had to sit diagonally on the toilet. The decor was last updated at least 30+ years ago, and that with the peeling paint from ceilings and walls left us feeling like the prices were much too high for what we were getting. ($130 per night) The included breakfast was terrible; an array of store bought muffins and toast, with only a small sample of fresh watermelon and 2 egg dishes, one of which I couldn't eat anyway as I am gluten-free and pregnant. This was not a sufficient start to my day and we had to go out and spend more money for breakfast anyway. The service was less than wonderful, although they were nice enough. We had to wait 45 mins for our room to be cleaned when we arrived, even though we arrived after check in time, then whenever I had a question, I had to interrupt conversations to get noticed. Finally, we actually left a day early, and after having to interrupt a conversation to turn in our key, they did not even ask why we were leaving early. I don't think they cared because they had their money. It is a nice location within walking distance to downtown Lenox and the common rooms are well decorated with antiques, however it seems to me that they've spent too much time and effort on their antiques, and not enough updating the rooms and taking care of the general condition of the house itself. I would not stay here again because there are so many other places to choose from in the area. And be sure to book months in advance, as the summer time fills up quick and early. Each thing in and of itself wasn't so bad, but all of them together left us feeling like we had spent too much money for not enough amenities. If you want to spend the money to stay in a bigger room, you might be happier. And also, they seem to only give attention to those who appear to have more money, so maybe you'd do well here if you look affluent.

We have both been to quite a few spas before and were truly looking forward to a great, relaxing, revitalizing few days. Instead, we ended up leaving after 1 1/2 days because we found the experience to be so unpleasant.
The entire place seemed more corporate/institutional than spa like. The rooms and grounds were tired and felt like a 3 star hotel. Even the soaps and shampoos were of low quality .
We love fresh healthy spa-like food. The food here was awful tasting and unappealing to the eye. It is really not too difficult to take fresh healthy ingredients and create simple and delicious healthy food. The foods all tasted as if they were created from inferior ingredients and prepared ahead of time. The flavors were muddled and created with dried stale tasting herbs. Nothing had a fresh or vibrant taste. It was more like hospital or airplane food than what one would expect to find at a spa. The only snacks around were institutional fruits, oranges, delicious apples, bananas and pears. Not a carrot stick or a spa cookie or smoothie to be had. WE asked four people where we could get a snack and finally someone took us to a hidden mini fridge behind an unmanned counter where they offered us string cheese and finally a trail bar (which was the only delicious thing we ate while there).
The spa services were truly sub-par and the spa itself was not quiet, tranquil, pretty or nice smelling.
The bright spot were the few exercise classes we attended which were lots of fun and a good workout. Women's stretch, morning run, morning walk, aqua fit and cardio circuit were all great.
I am really perplexed by all of the positive reviews on Tripadvisor. My only guess is that people have not been to other spas and therefore did not have a basis for comparison. Maybe people truly believe that low-calorie food has to be punitive to the tastebuds. I don't know, but all I can suggest is that if you are a sophisticated traveler/spa goer, you will not like the general vibe or the food or the spa services or the accommodations at Canyon Ranch, Lenox.
I will close by saying that the staff was cooperative about letting us out of our commitment to stay for four nights.

'Save up your $$ and go!! Well worth it!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 6, 2012

I had always felt a trip like this would do me good but that it was out of my reach financially. I took advantage of a promotion they were running, and although still an extravagance, I have to say I am so glad I went. From the moment I stepped off the Amtrak train at Albany, I was engulfed by a feeling of restfulness. A wonderful driver was there waiting to take me on the 45 minute drive to Canyon Ranch and I just knew the instant he said hello to me that I was going to have a great time. I went alone, which is what I needed to do for myself, but since my return, everyone I know insists they are joining me the next time - even my husband. We'll see if that happens...I loved being alone and focusing only on my health and well-being for a change! Arrival and check-in were very smooth; my room was not ready when I got there (way before 3 pm as I wanted to take advantage of as much as possible), so I went to Easter brunch which was delicious. In general I found all the food to be very yummy and I was never hungry throughout my four days there! My room was all the way at the end of the West wing, which meant I had a good seven or so minute walk to the spa, the dining hall, the locker rooms, etc. I liked the room location because it was very quiet. I didn't mind, though, since I was so energized the whole time I was there, and if you plan your day well, you rarely have to go back to your room at all during the day. The room itself was lovely, clean, comfortable. I wouldn't say it was five-star luxurious, considering the amount you are paying, but it is very lovely and cozy. There are some cute touches in the room, like a CD alarm clock and CD's with restful music on them for you to listen to; there's also filtered water, a small fridge, a safe, a robe, and great reading lights over the bed, all things I appreciated.
Shortly after arriving I met with a "program advisor." For me this was not so useful as I had already pretty much decided everything I wanted to do while I was there and had spoken to an advisor before I arrived. I had no interest in having medical treatments or examinations. However, the advisor was very friendly and supportive and I was impressed that two days later when I ran in to her in the hallway, she remembered me.
A great thing about CR in Lenox is that in bad weather, you never have to go outside. Everything is cleverly connected via a lovely heated and attractive walkway. On the other hand, the grounds are very pretty and it was nice, when the weather was good, to sit outside reading a book or just take a stroll.
On two days, I was dropped off and picked up for shopping, once in the town of Lenox (where there was one particular shop, a yarn store, that I wanted to see), and the second day I went to the local outlets. If I return to CR I will skip the outlets next time. They are underwhelming and I would have rather spent the time in another terrific class or at the gym. But I note this here because I was so impressed by the staff's determination to assist me and support me in my desire to shop! They went out of their way to make sure I could do both of these things and provided me with reliable transportation, which I really appreciated.
Now to the stuff I actually came for...I wanted to try new things, do some moving, and refocus myself on health and wellness. I loved the fitness and exercise classes that I took. In one class, myself and one other woman were the only participants and it was like having a personal trainer. I also took other classes, such as a circuit weights class that was so much fun, and a stretch class that was excellent. On two days, I had the entire swimming pool to myself for about two hours each day; that was an unbelievable treat. I found the pool to be underutilized and I am not sure why, it is a beautiful pool. The steam rooms and whirlpool were also great. I love the nonjudgmental atmosphere of the place, the supportive environment, and the incredible diversity of women in all kinds of shape who were there for the same reasons I was there. And it was not just women; there were quite a few couples, and yes, some men were there solo as well. This is a great place to go in any configuration, because they make it very "homey" for you.
I did a lot of treatments while I was there as I decided this was going to be a self-indulgent few days for me, something I don't often do. The deep tissue massage was excellent, as were the facial and the sea salt scrub. The one treatment I would not do again is the 'Lavender Relax.' This is just my personal preference; it was a lovely treatment but now that I've done it, I don't think I'd feel the need to try it again. In general I would do fewer treatments next time (and thus, save a bunch of money), and focus more on the classes and opportunities for movement. This is not a commentary about the treatments, only on my personal preferences. By the way, the official policy is "no tipping" and its impressive that despite this policy, CR has managed to attract and retain some excellent service providers, but I know from speaking to several of them that the tipping policy is a bone of contention and I wonder how much better the services would be if tipping were encouraged. (They are supposed to refuse tips. I'd rather pay less for my overall stay and then tip for service myself).
My one disappointment with the experience were the two lectures I attended. On my first day there I attended a lecture on wellness and intention. On the second day I attended one on weight management. Unfortunately, both lectures were given by the same person and they were virtually identical. I wish she had told those of us at the first one that she would be facilitating again the second day and that the sessions were going to be similar; there were other things I could have gone to instead. That being said, when she finally got to substantive matters in both lectures, the classes were almost over. 45 minutes is not really enough time if you want to have a substantive conversation. I would say that out of 45 minutes in each lecture, 30 minutes were basics - very basics, especially if you've done any work on nutrition or weight management at all. They were not too dissimilar from a Weight Watchers gathering. However, these were minor disappointments when put in the context of my entire experience, which was truly a wonderful one overall.
If you are looking for pure relaxation and a chance to be good to yourself, sleep well, be active and recharge yourself, this is the place to be. I've already told my husband I'll be saving up to go again. While three nights did not change my life, it did help me reprioritize myself and I did come home feeling very recharged, something I cannot say about every vacation I have. I wish it were not so expensive - but this time, at least, it was worth the money to have four days that were all about me! Unfortunately it has taken me too many weeks more than I hoped to sit down and write this review, but my experience there was so strong, I am still feeling the impact two months later. All I can say is, GO!

'After 15 years, my daughter and I still love it'

My daughter (now age 37) says that our mother-daughter visits to Canyon Ranch in the Berkshires over the past 15 years have profoundly influenced who she has become. And Canyon Ranch has helped me move through my 50's and into my 60's and still maintain a strong body and a healthy approach to life. The grounds are peaceful to the point of being surreal, beautiful in all four seasons. From the moment we arrive for our visit, we feel that we have returned to our very special sanctuary for body, mind, and spirit.

'A little clinical but a friendly and comfortable home base in the Berkshires'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 11, 2012 NEW

In an area full of lovely, personality filled (and often overpriced) accomodations, the Hampton Inn doesn't offer a lot of character. It is located on a particularly uncharming stretch of highway. However, the hotel does go above and beyond in other departments. First of all, their rates are excellent considering it is summer in the Berkshires. Second, the hotel is very conveniently located (about a 5 minute drive) from the wonderful town center of Lenox as well as hiking, biking, historical properties like The Mount, Edith Wharton's former home. The property has some expected amenities like a small but pretty indoor pool, a clean fitness center, a great breakfast spread plus all day coffee and tea and a little candy shop. The staff is not only welcoming but very knowledgable (they easily directed us to a difficult to find hiking spot). The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable. It isn't the most memorable place but it is a solid choice of lodging.

This Hampton Inn is a fairly new one and well appointed. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. It is a couple of miles from Lenox itself but is well situated to explore the general Berkshire area. Since it's on "motel row" you have to really look for the little sign. The Hampton Inn is set back from the main road....which makes it quiet but hard to find. We drove by it twice before seeing the sign. Not their fault..it seems the city fathers control the signage.

We stayed here over the weekend because I was taking a cheese class in Ashfield, Mass and all of the hotels in that area were booked thanks to UMass' graduation. Boy did we luck out! The room was on the first floor and VERY spacious. The bed was surprisingly comfortable and the room was very clean. We loved the 24 hour a day cookies/coffee/hot chocolate. It was a great snack after a long drive up.

Our stay was even more delightful when we got up the next morning for breakfast. Even though we were only a couple of doors down from the lobby, we didn't hear any of the noise from guests eating breakfast from our room. The breakfast was delicious. Steak and eggs and tortillas to turn them into breakfast burritos, cheese omelets, pancakes, waffles, hot oatmeal, breakfast pastries, yogurt, the whole nine yards. This was one of the best breakfasts we have had and we travel a lot!

After finishing up our breakfast, the front desk manager made his way around the tables. He was very personable and we really enjoyed the conversation with him. It was great to have such a friendly and welcoming staff during our stay.

I would absolutely recommend this hotel to others who are staying in the Berkshires.

This was our first visit to the Hampton Suites in Lenox. We were pleasantly surprised with our experience. The hotel staff greeted us warmly and provided us with local information about sites and restaurants to choose from me. Our room was on the second floor, although the view was disappointing, the room was quite large, very clean and included a whirlpool. The breakfast was robust and plentiful. The hotel location was perfect, right in between Lenox. Lee and Stockbridge. We were most impressed with a member of the hotel staff who asked how we were enjoying our stay (while at breakfast). During our discussion, she offered us discount tickets to the Norman Rockwell Museum ($12 instead of $16) and a certificate for a free print at the Museum Shop. She also gave us some handy tips on additional restaurants and coffee shops to try. Very friendly and accommodating. We plan to go back in early December and plan to stay at the Hampton Suites. Excellent!

Our first time ever at a Hampton property and we were very satisfied. We wanted a centrally located hotel because we would be driving around - Lenox, Stockbridge, Williamstown, etc. This Hampton is perfect for that - off a major road but set back and quiet. If you want to walk around in town, this location is definitely not it. It's very close to Pittsfield and Pittsfield is not a classic pretty New England town - lots of auto repair shops, liquor stores, etc. For walking around in a scenic environment go stay right in town in Lenox.

Our room was clean and spacious - comfortable bed, good water pressure, nice kitchenette (sink, fridge and microwave), sofa, desk, good lighting and air. I noticed the room, the lobby and the hallways were maintained very well - no obvious scrapes, stains, nicks. Everything in the place worked which is great. We missed breakfast every morning except once when I managed to get there exactly at 10am - surprisingly, everything was still there, neat and still welcoming. There's coffee and tea in the lobby all the time. We noticed cookies and fruit too.

Housekeeping was very good. We leave a tip & thank you note for the housekeeper every morning even on check out morning and one housekeeper did leave a return thank you note. The front desk was very competent. They were friendly enough by saying good morning and hello but no one cracked a smile especially at check in and check out. I thought that was strange since everything else about the property was very good.

OK, maybe not EVERY way. The elevator was jumpy. That's the only negative. Other than that, this hotel was marvelous. It's only a few years old so everything feels brand-smacking new. It's behind another building on Route 7, so you don't get the road noise. We faced the back so all we saw were woods. I heard no noise from the hallways or other rooms. The beds were comfortable. The business center was very nice. The breakfast was really good. And thank you, Hampton Inn, for being environmentally conscious with your plates and utensils. I liked the little grocery market, where you could purchase ice cream and other goodies.

The staff was very nice. They let us check in early, which was very helpful. I highly recommend this hotel and it would be my first choice for staying in the Berkshires.

We stayed at the Hampton Berkshires in October, 2011 for three nights. When I started researching the trip, I was rather surprised at the lack of mid-priced lodgings in the Berkshires - a Comfort Inn at $200 a night?? The Hampton was a good choice, and worth the relatively high price. We had a king suite, and the space in the room was amazing. There was a mini-fridge and coffee area, and the toilet and shower were in separated from the sink, which was in the main part of the room in an alcove.

The staff were all pleasant, and gave us flashlights when the area was hit with a power outage. The breakfast seating area was the largest I've seen in this type of hotel, and much appreciated. Unbeknown to us, we left our camera charger in the room, and they called us and mailed it back.

The only negatives about the property was a lack of a place to hang towels by the sink. The only towel rack was in the toilet/shower room, so the hand towels just had to be left on the sink countertop. Also, the cleaning person left a dirty cleaning rag on the kitchenette countertop by the entrance door on our first morning, and it remained there until we checked out.

This hotel is near but not close to any of the places you're likely to want to visit. It seemed like we did a lot of driving to and from our sightseeing. Also, the choices for dinner close by were fairly limited.

Blantyre transports you to another era. It's probably the single most beautiful manor at which we've had the opportunity to stay. The service is absolutely perfect, and our weekend days included a wine tasting, high tea, a walk on the beautiful grounds, and relaxing in the spa. Two days here feels like you've spent a week decompressing. Expensive but you'll never forget it -- this is a true stand out.

'Most incredible hotel I have ever stayed in!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed April 28, 2012

person found this review helpful

I have stayed in many world class hotels but this one has them all beat. Some hotels are spectacular because of the scenery, some the accommodations, some the service, or even the food; but this hotel has them all. We went for a long weekend in January and have wanted to return ever since. I was supposed to go with my husband but since he had to work I took a close friend. We stayed in the two bedroom Ice house and it was truly magical. I felt like we had our own cabin in the woods. Everything that you could possibly want or need was available at our fingertips. I wish I had the words to be able to truly express how magical this place is. When we arrived, even though we had both driven they took our bags and put them into the resorts car and guided us to our cottage. They built us a fire, put our bags in our rooms and gave us a tour of the cottage. It had a wonderful window seat in a bay window in the living room, a sun room built entirely of windows with a sofa, chairs and a table, there was a hidden flat screen tv in the living room with a variety of movies (more available upon request) and a dining room with an antique table for 6. There was brand new stainless steel kitchen with luxury dishes and cook wear, complimentary drinks in the refrigerator as well as a welcome basket with fruits, teas, cookies and chocolates. The master bedroom located on the main level was large, bright and spacious with a changing area/walk in closet and an enormous bathroom with a separate shower and bathtub, dual sinks and the toilet was behind its own door (water pressure was excellent). In the morning, they send in several people at once to clean, to cut down the amount of time that they are there. At turn down, we were given a box of chocolates as well as the blantyre cookbook, which is beautifully done, my friend, who was staying in the bedroom downstairs, received the same thing. Although the other bedroom is downstairs with its own bathroom, it is still above ground and both bedrooms have decks that you can walk out on or have a meal. While we were there we went ice skating, (they even have a hot chocolate menu you can order from while on the rink. We took a carriage ride, went snow shoeing, had massages and just generally explored. The food was exceptional, especially dinner, their sommelier was incredible, we had no desire to go anywhere else. Before dinner, they bring you drinks and canaps. I could go on forever about this place but I think this one experience will sum it up, my friend was starting to get sick so we called the front desk to see where the closest grocery store to buy cough drops was, they said they would call right back and about 10 minutes later the grounds keeper knocked on our door with a bag of cough drops, he said "I didn't know what flavor or brand you wanted so I got them all" furthermore, he refused to allow us to pay them or accept a tip. Blantyre really goes beyond every expectation. I can't wait to return

Harking back to a bygone era of style, wonderful service and amazing attention to detail our all too brief four night stay at Blantyre will definitely reside in my memory as one of the most enchanting trips I've ever taken. The Laurel Suite was a beautifully appointed combination of antique packed rooms that overlooked the magnificent MA landscape of rolling hills and forest. The bathroom was large, warm and comfortable with an amazing shower and claw foot tub. We had delicious breakfasts and dinners, they also have an amazing wine-cellar with thousands of incredible varieties and vintages to choose from, from around the globe. We also enjoyed some wonderful spa treatments - and even got to ice skate on their private rink. Each evening a pianist discretely entertains in the main drawing room for the cocktail hour. The staff are charming and totally invested in the well-being of the guest. If you can appreciate being taken perfect care of, then I insist you visit Blantyre.

'Very Nice But Not Incredibly Exceptional'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed February 28, 2012

person found this review helpful

With all the wonderful, glowing reviews of this property, I had to really question our own experience to see if there was something at fault with my opinion of the weekend before writing this review. . . but here it is. I thinki this is a very beautiful property. It is a wonderful spot for a romantic weekend or a gathering of friends. I do think the 20 percent service charge added to everything is very high, and we really didn't find the food (dinner and breakfast) to be exceptional. Perhaps it was because we were there in the off season? I'm not sure.

I will say that probably a lot of the allure of Blantyre is the experience of it all. We chose to eat in our accommodations rather than experiencing the dinner service in the dining room. I do regret that. The poor weather also prevented us from experiencing all the resort had to offer (i.e. the snowshoeing and ice skating ). . . which I had been so looking forward to.

The dangerous thing about TripAdvisor is other reviewers set the bar so high with some properties that it is very hard for the experience of other guests to live up to theirs every single time. For example, I was really looking forward to the bottle of champagne upon arrival that others noted (we were celebrating my 40th birthday) but received a half bottle of red instead. Our particular accommodations, while nice, were also not up to the standard of a $1000-a-night accommodation though I couldn't find any past reviewers that had stayed where we were located.

All that said, I think back to a weekend spent at the White Barn Inn in Kennebunkport, the only other Relais and Chateaux property in which I have stayed. The weather that weekend was terrible too but I had an absolutely unforgettable time thanks to an extremely attentive staff, sumptuous food, and a very cozy room. If I compare the two properties, I don't think they are of the same caliber . . . at least that was our experience.

'The Finest Hotel (small or otherwise) in America'

person found this review helpful

My husband and I stay at the Blantyre once or twice a year, most recently in October 2011 when we had the pleasure of also attending their Roderer Estate Champagne Dinner. I agree with other commenters that this property is nothing short of amazing. Ms. Fitzpatrick Brown has truly done something exceptional in not only the decor and ambiance of the property but in her training of the staff, as well. You'll feel whisked away to a long-lost time and place. Each room has a curated collection of fine antiques and books and high-quality dvd's and cd's. You feel as if you are staying in the fine country home of someone with exquisite taste, and really, you are. We have stayed in the Patterson Suite, which is absolutely enormous (with two separate bathrooms!) and also some of the smaller rooms, like The Orchard Suite in the Carriage House. Staying in the rooms in the Carriage House is nice if you are going to be using the beautiful pool or the super-relaxing spa. In the winter time, it's nice to stay in the rooms in the main house, as most of them have fireplaces. The food is exceptional and keep in mind a full (and I mean enormous) breakfast is included in your room rate.

Ms. Fitzpatrick Brown spares no expense nor any effort in making your stay something you will never forget. Do not let the price put you off in booking a stay here. It is worth every penny.

'Extraordinary Elegance and Kindness'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed November 6, 2011
5
people found this review helpful

I recently spent an unforgettable overnight at Blantyre. As numerous reviews attest, the place is extraordinary. No detail goes unnoticed. I have stayed in many hotels and this one truly distinguishes itself from the rest. It's difficult to even think of it as a hotel! You do feel more as if you've been invited to a friend's country manor.

I was traveling to Lenox to have dinner with the high school guidance counselor who had turned my life around, and who I had not seen in 45 years. After reading reviews of restaurants in Lenox, I chose Blantyre for what promised to be a very special dinner.
An unseasonal snowstorm arrived soon after I did, and by 5:00 p.m., the roads were blanketed. The restaurant stayed open, and, not wanting to brave the roads twice, I reserved a second room for my guests, who--though both in their eighties--were ready for the adventure. When we arrived back at Blantyre, we were greeted outside by 4 or 5 people, including Ann Brown, the owner. Ann was so excited that we'd made it and so happy for us that she offered a free room for my guests that night. With a guest who was more than willing to pay for the room, I found Ann's generosity remarkable. And it's that remarkable generosity of spirit that makes Blantyre so special. It begins with Ann, and was evident in every single staff person I met there. Although I'm sure the staff is held to a high standard, I felt the staff members I met were genuinely good-natured and enjoyed providing a memorable experience to guests.

So we dined at leisure, in our own beautifully appointed small dining room, with wait staff that were nothing less than courtly, without being pretentious. When we wanted a photograph, someone appeared with a camera. The next day a disposable camera materialized. The dinner was extraordinary-- perfectly prepared and delicious. The creme brulee was the best I've ever tasted. We lingered over dinner for hours, and then were driven to our rooms in the carriage house. My room was as lovely and as comfortable as has been reported in other reviews.

In the morning, we were driven to the main house again for a sumptuous breakfast and, while we ate and talked, the amazing staff were busily digging out and cleaning off my car.
All in all, the Blantyre was much more than I'd hoped and I am looking forward to my next visit there. Try it. You won't be disappointed!

'Lovely and Magical'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed October 25, 2011

The people are warm and go out of their way to make your stay exceptional. We stayed in one of the rooms in the carriage house called Brookside. We loved it. The room is beautiful and elegant but also comfortable and homey. As we entered our room right behind us they came in with champagne accompanied by a cheese and fruit plate. A nice way to start our adventure. We had dinner at their restaurant the first night and the experience was wonderful. You enter the main room with the scent of the fireplace and the sound of the piano in the air. You are given tasty canapes to start in the main room before dinner. We made our dinner and wine selections and then after a nice relaxing time were brought into the dining room. I must stop here and just say that the service and the people that work here are all amazing, friendly and go out of their way to add to your experience at Blantyre.The meal was wonderful from beginning to end. Fine dining indeed!

In addition to the property it is the local area that adds to this experience. We went for a nice hike up Monument Mountain one day and then to Ice Glen the next. Amazing hikes and great views.

We had dinner in Lenox at a great restaurant called Nudel. Great food bursting with flavors.

Blantyre is one for the memory books and we will be returning over and over. We loved it and highly, highly recommend it.

'Truly extraordinary- a peek into life in the gilded ages'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed October 10, 2011

A stay at Blantyre allows you to experience what life must have been like during the gilded age, prior to nuisances like the income tax, and working to earn a living, got in the way, and the Berkshire "cottages" like Blantyre were basically abandoned.
We had a truly extraordinary and might I say magical, stay at Blantyre. While my wife and I are widely traveled and love to stay at fine places, a stay at the Ice House, a two bedroom cottage that Ann Brown, the owner, kindly offered us, at 2k a night for just the room, would probably be out of our league.
Before I proceed, in terms of full disclosure, we did not have to pay for our stay at Blantyre as I had won an event where the prize was a two day stay with all meals and wine included. But as a frequent traveler and TA contributor, I will attempt to be completely objective in this review.
Blantyre is just as my title says, truly extraordinary. At any of the world's great hotels, however perfect their location, the mark of distinction is mostly carried by the quality of the service and the staff. Here Blantyre shines- the service was without any doubt exceptional throughout. From the moment we reached, we were whisked into this magical world, where there was nothing required except savoring the champagne and the world of Blantyre that Mrs Brown has so lovingly created.
The property is beautifully maintained and the absolutely gorgeous weather the weekend we were there added to the Berkshires beauty in the fall, but Blantyre shines by itself, creating an ambiance regardless of the weather. There is a very nice hiking trail right on the property, if you do not want to go outside. The Potting Shed, Blantyre's spa is perfectly situated on the property and the staff, like all of Blantyre's shine. I am not much of a spa person, but my wife, who has indulged across the globe said the treatment was comparable to the best.
I will comment on the food and wine. The food was excellent, the chef's creativity was challenged by my wife having the vegetarian tasting menu and I the regular one, and he delivered in spades. The vegetarian menu was amazing and I kept asking for a taste (which after the first one) was firmly denied.
And then the wine. We are both very wine centric with a cellar at home, but I have to say, this was one of the "wine weekends" of our lives, comparable to our trips to Bordeaux, the Rhone valley and Brunello (Montepulcino). I owe a debt of gratitude to Luc Chevalier, the amazing sommelier for making our stay so memorable. His knowledge, sensitivity to the guests palate, and ability to match just the right wine with whatever one is eating, is sheer perfection.
In summary, I am determined to go back, this time on our own dime.

Two days here was as restorative as a week spent elsewhere. Blantyre is like the house you've always wanted - but better. The rooms are all unique, and the linens are so cozy I found myself writing down the names on the tag to order for my home. The service was exceptional but unobtrusive; it's an incredibly special place that makes you feel as if you're going back in time to a kinder, more luxurious era. I'm sending all my friends!

My fiancee Bob and I receive the daily Living Social deals. In January of 2012 we received one for Hampton Terrace and I am so glad that we did. We booked in January for the weekend of May 25th. We really needed the time to get away and relax and that is exactly what we did. Our room was so quaint...love the claw foot tub and the red decor (my favorite color), Stan and Susan were so gracious and Atticus was adorable. The Inn is so well maintained and there is so much attention to detail inside and outside. The pool is so clean with a perfect temperature for relaxing. The only thing I could think of when I was leaving was why didn't I book us for a longer stay?? In closing, We are looking forward to returning hopefully in the fall to catch the fall foliage. Thanks again to Stan and Susan for sharing their beautiful Inn!

We arrived late on a Friday nigh but Stan had left detailed instructions as to how to get to our room and to make ourselves feel at home. Easy instructions found us in a delightful room in a carriage house just off the main Inn which my husband and I enjoyed as we were looking for a quiet "romantic" weekend away. Stan the InnKeeper was a very informative and warm host and the breakfast was wonderful! I loved the location of the Inn as we could walk and enjoy the ambience that Lenox has to offer.

'Very pleasant spot'

My husband and I stayed here overnight on a Saturday at the beginning of June. The staff members at check-in were pleasant and helpful. We had a king room in the Founders Cottage, which I gather is one of the newer buildings at the facility. Our room was huge. It was clean and very comfortable, and included two upholstered chairs, a desk, and a very large entry area with a sink, coffee maker and mini-frig. The bathroom was also quite big, with double sinks. We were in town to attend a wedding at a different site, so we didn't have occasion to eat at this hotel. We did have a drink in the tavern, which was nice but rather small. We didn't spend much time at the Cranwell and we didn't try out the main features of the resort (golf and spa), so that's why I only gave it 4 stars, but our overnight stay at the Founders Cottage was very pleasant.

Recently my family came to stay at Cranwell, staying in Founders, to attend a special family event nearby. As usual they had nothing but very positive observations about the room with patio that they were given--except that the perverse weather was too cool to enjoy the patio! They had stayed at Cranwell before in the same building and were equally pleased then. I was thrilled to have the chance to enjoy the breakfast buffet with them in the mansion the next morning. The food was plentiful and there were lots of choices. The wait staff was just as nice as they could be and catered to our special requests without missing a beat. Even the omelette chef was pleasant and informative about the choices available and he and the staff stood in the doorway when we left and invited us to come back soon. A relaxed and thoroughly pleasant way to begin a weekend!

It was our first time to cranwell. We went in the off season and were upgraded to a better room. It ended up being a huge suite. It had it's own patio so it would have been nice if it were warmer out. We took advantage of the workout room and pool and had a drink in the lounge after we got back from dinner. Everything was clean, quiet, and comfortable. The only con was that one of the showers didn't work quite right and there were some water marks on the ceiling of the shower. We had breakfast the next morning and that was also very good. I'd go back again if I get another deal (we had one of those coupon deals).

'A very mixed bag... the price is high though.'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed May 29, 2012

We just go back from a family get together (4 rooms) at the Cranwell over Memorial Day weekend 2012. 2nd stay. Key points:
Th good:
Beautiful grounds and lovely location
GREAT massages and Spa facility. Very, very nice.
Nice staff - clearly overwhelmed.
Very nice chipping area for practice golf.
The pool was nice- and they turned on the heater for the second day.
One room had to be changed because of mouse droppings in the bathroom, sofa, etc.
One room had to be changed because the air conditioner didn't work.
The golf course was not up to muni course standards - let alone resort. Overgrown and not maintained except for the greens - nice looking but slow as mud.
The food was medicore - the breakfast buffet was a small step above a Hilton Garden Inn. Rangy bacon, french toast that had been there for hours (and hardened) overcooked omelettes were Bill's specialty - really? THAT brown? Yikes. Strawberries were not even clipped of their green leaves. Hopefully they were washed.
Dinner was basically banquet food- overcooked filet, killed salmon, etc. The salad was good though.
The tavern restaurant was better since last time I was there. Food and service improved from two stars to three on them.
Truthfully, if it wasn't for the great massage - would really have hated it.

Thank you for your review and comments regarding your most recent stay. Your feedback is very important to us. We're happy to read how much you enjoyed the staff, spa and grounds, including the chipping area. The course was a bit slow due to the recent rain, as can be the case this time of year. We're very sorry for the need to change rooms. Each concern was addressed immediately and we do hope you appreciated the consideration extended due to the inconvenience of having to move. We also hope the alternate rooms were comfortable for your visit. We will of course review your concerns relating to our food with our Executive Chef; we are always looking to satisfy all of our guests' individual preferences.

'Wonderful family getaway'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 28, 2012

Spent Memorial Day Weekend here as a surprise for my wife. We have two small children so we got a suite which was fantastic. Some notes:

Pros:

Suite was spacious, comfortable and clean. Sliding door between rooms makes it great for families. Loved the jacuzzi tub.

Grounds are beautiful (despite construction). Great place just to walk around for an hour or two.

Staff was very friendly.

Location! A lot of attractions for families, art lovers, antiquers, hikers etc. Great little restaurants in the area (we enjoyed a brunch at The Haven in Lenox)

Excellent food in Sloane's Tavern and the breakfast buffet.

Cons:

Housekeeping did not show up until 1:30pm, smack dab in the middle of my children's nap time.

The reservation person with whom I spoke was very rude and clueless.

Tips:

Search for rates on internet, can get a much better deal than calling.

We loved the Berkshire Museum and Hancock Shaker Village. Did not get to the Rockwell Museum, the wildlife land or Tanglewood, but they are on our list!

'Tired and over priced'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed May 22, 2012

This property is tired and significantly over priced for what you get. The room had cracked bathroom tiles, with pieces missing, dings and dents and just not that clean. I think from looking at other reviews there are "new parts" - obviuosly I was in the "old rooms".
The front desk staff were friendly and efficient. The main restaurant had old world charm but was not clean, even had guests sitting on broken chairs. The staff had little communication between themselves so repetitively asked the same questions.
Has a lot of potential but really needs strong management to get the place in shape.

'Fantastic Experience in the Berkshires'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 21, 2012

My wife and I stayed at the Cranwell Resort to celebrate our anniversary and we had an amazing experience from beginning to end. Our room was in the Founders Cottage and was perfect, in between the spa, gym and indoor pool and the main restaurants. Big, clean and quiet, and had its own Keurig coffee brewer as well which we enjoyed. The grounds of the resort were immaculate and the customer service we experienced from everyone we encountered was top notch. When we checked in, we were given a voucher for a complimentary bottle of wine to enjoy at the restaurant which we appreciated! The spa was outstanding, and we both enjoyed the indoor pool, steam room, sauna and whirlpool. I tried the "head in the clouds" massage from Katie which was unbelievable, and my wife really enjoyed her swedish massage. The sandals, bathrobes and towels provided at the spa were a nice touch, and it was nice to be able to walk to and from your room with them.

We ate at all three restaurants and the food was excellent. We had lunch outside at Sloane's Tavern overlooking the golf course, and the burgers were fantastic. Dinner at Wyndhurst Restaurant in the historic mansion was perfect. There were only 14 or so tables in a very elegant room overlooking the Berkshire mountains, with quiet classical music playing in the background. I had quail stuffed with wild boar stuffing which was the best, and my wife had a crazy delicious salmon meal. We had a banana fosters bread chocolate bread pudding for desert which was also incredible. The host of the restaurant stopped by our table to talk about the history of the place which was very interesting. Finally the breakfast buffet in the Music Room the next day was also outstanding. Fresh fruit, cottage cheese, scrambled eggs, french toast, muffins, pastries, corn beef hash, hash browns and an omelet station.

This resort exceeded are high expectations, and we are looking forward to coming back in the future.

'Weekend Escape'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 21, 2012

If you're looking for a quiet, elegant, weekend escape without overbearing staff or too much fluff this is the place! We just got back from two nights at the Wheatleigh and were beyond impressed with the staff, property, rooms and amenities. Tennis- no problem. Bikes- of course. Picnic under a tree with a hammock- you say when. It was honestly like they anticipated our every need and desire. Terry was wonderful helping me coordinate a surprise picnic for our anniversary. The food was delicious, inventive and comforting all in the same bite. The Wheatleigh was the perfect quiet romantic getaway we were looking for!

We cannot wait to return to the Wheatleigh and spend more time at this gem of a hotel!

'Good Anniversary Treat'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed January 5, 2012

One of the few places in that area willing to consider a one-night stay during an October weekend. The refurb done by Tsao McKown still looks great. We arrived Saturday afternoon in time to have a welcome glass of champagne and make it over to the Edith Wharton house/museum before it closed. Got an upgrade from standard to deluxe room which made us very happy (I think only two other rooms were booked for that night). Enjoyed use of the tennis court the next morning before breakfast and a late check out at 1pm. Only downside of being one of the few guests was that there tended to be almost to much attention paid to us by a fairly young staff. But considering the overall cost, you have will have certainly paid for it. We would definitely make a return visit.

We are a young couple from New York. We went up to the Berkshires for a short weekend getaway and were also attending the BSO performance at Tanglewood. We decided to stay at Wheatleigh for the first time. We were surprised to see the staff waiting at the driveway with a warm, welcome smile and who couldn't wait to welcome us inside. We had some welcome champagne at the back Terrace before heading to our room. The view was magnificent overlooking to the mountains and lake. This place is exactly what my husband and I wanted. It was so peaceful. The service was extremely personalized. The Front office agent offered us a tour of the property and also gave us a short orientation about the history of the Wheatleigh. Even though it was built in 1893 the interior and architectural design is modernistic. Especially for us, we love staying at a modern and up to fashion hotel which seems hard to find in the Berkshires. We also saw the fitness room and a wonderful wine cellar. There was a great collection of wines from around the world. We were even offered a wine tasting at the end of our tour. We were extremely happy and already enjoying our time here. The last thing we saw was the outdoor heated pool; again I could not believe there is such thing like Wheatleigh up here in the Berkshires. It was such a lovely setting. We requested for an Aromatherapy massage on Saturday by the pool and the hotel was kind enough to arrange for us at the last minute. Our room was a Junior suite on the 2nd floor overlooking the mountain sand the lake with a private covered balcony. We couldn't ask for more with the price we've paid. The room was equipped with a Bang& Olufsen entertainment system and a powermat for my Ipad and Black Berry. At first I couldn't understand how to use it but the agent noticed and immediately explained it to me. For dinner that evening we went down to the AAA 5 diamond awarded Dining room. We were greeted by the host from the stairway down to the great hall. We were laughing to each other and still can't believe these young people are so detail oriented and passionate about what they are doing. I noticed the entire staff was young but provided such an exceptional service. We had the seven course chef's tasting menu and were completely filled, but it was a delicious dinner. Throughout our stay we were completely spoiled; it was a memorable experience with prompt service. We will definitely return, let us hope our work gives us more days like this. Thank you to all for such a wonderful weekend.

'Peace and Rest'

I have a soft spot for Wheatleigh. My husband and I make an annual pilgrimage to dine there, and recently stayed for the second time at the hotel. One certainly can be at peace here, a transformation that is sometimes instantaneous for me, sitting on deck chairs in one of the most enchantingly peaceful spots in the Berkshires, overlooking the Berks hills (not mountains, but pleasing nonetheless), and the massive trees found throughout the property. This is a quiet place that exudes elegance and historical substance and doesn't feel overly opulent despite the Italianate mansion aspect of the place, because of the spare, modern furnishings. (As an aside, if you haven't been and are comparing to Blantyre, the interiors are vastly different, so check out the photos carefully-- I think of Blantyre as a 'winter, cozy by fireside' spot, and a bit too gloomy for me for the summertime). I was grateful that we were upgraded when we arrived, given that it was our 20th anniversary, never take that sort of thing for granted, and found ourselves in a lovely room overlooking the courtyard fountain, and given some bubbly to celebrate. I can understand why some reviewers here would balk at the price. It is expensive, but that's why we just like to 'hang out' on the property and it feels worth it if that's how you like to spend your time away, without too many other people, if any, to contend with. There is also a lovely staff to welcome you and assist, and though some are 'newbies' they are earnest and sincere. You can literally walk to Tanglewood, for more lawns and massive trees, with music as an accompaniment. One word of advice-- I found that the main restaurant was closed midweek, and although we were able to eat in the library, the food was just not of the standard as the main restaurant, or perhaps I just felt the lack of choices on the prix fixe menu. The experience is decidedly different, and was not my idea of our grand 20th anniversary meal-- however, we have built up sufficient wonderful gastronomic memories there and nostalgia to have tossed off that particular dining experience. So if you are going for the 'total' experience, do make sure you can make a reservation in the main dining room, and that it is open.

We wanted to bring house guests to visit Wheatleigh for drinks on our way to Tanglewood. After calling the prior day, specifying the time of our visit and being assured of welcoming hospitality, we were coldly informed by a uniformed doorman that we should wait while he checked with the restaurant manager. A few minutes later, he returned to tell us that, "No one is available to serve us" and, "Sorry, but you must leave." You can imagine how embarrassed we were to be rudely turned away in front of friends -- especially when a couple seated nearby was enjoying drinks served by a waitress. Avoid this snooty place at all costs. Go to Blantyre or Cranwell.

'A Clean, Pleasant, Hotel for a Family Weekend Getaway'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 28, 2012
1
person found this review helpful

We chose this hotel based on it's proximity to the Lenox area in the Berkshires; an area we hade never been to, but wanted to visit. The reviews were good and it was priced affordably, so we took a chance. The reason the place is affordable is that it sits a couple of miles outside Lenox, the more desired swanky little sister town with the cutesy shops. The hotel itself sits on Route 7, so you are not too isolated. But it turns out the place was perfect for a family of 4 with 2 five-year olds. The place was very clean, the staff was very pleasant, and the rooms were well insulated against hallway noise. There were 2 pools, so you can swim inside or out, and neither were crowded. The outdoor pool was colder, but the indoor pool features an skylighted roof, so it feels like you are outside. A nice bonus was the free continental breakfast. They offered everything from homemade waffles to fresh pastries. They even had made-to-order omelets on the weekends. Trust me, for some places, "free continental breakfast" equates to apples and some prepackaged Entemann's danishes. This was a fair deal. There isn't a ton of things to do for kids under 7, so you need to be a little creative, like picnicking at a nearby lake or going for ice cream. It should be noted we weren't looking for amusement parks and just wanted a clean place with a pool to chill out for a few days. If that is your bag, then the Yankee Inn is great choice.

We were looking for a last-minute, inexpensive place to stay in the Lenox area, and this fit the bill -- my 4 out of 5 rating is due to the high value factor, as well as the very friendly and helpful staff. But note that this is not a modern or renovated hotel by any means -- the rooms, lobby, and common areas are fairly clean but a bit dated/tired. If you're looking for something more relaxing and upscale, there are numerous luxurious hotels/B&Bs that we've stayed at in the area but get pricey quickly...

Front desk staff was very pleasant on arrival, gave me a free upgrade to a better room. Suggested local restaurants for dinner, and provided a discount coupon. Room was spacious and fairly comfortable. Bathroom was dated, and shower had a large amount of water trapped under the tub! Felt like I was standing on a raft. After showering, some of the water under the tub was forced out onto the floor, leading to a minor flood. Very odd situation. Breakfast was adequate at best, typically forgettable hotel continental breakfast. Internet connection worked well.

My husband and I stayed at the Yankee Inn for a weekend getaway in April 2012. The place is not fancy, but it is very pleasant and clean, and the price is reasonable. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. Our room had a gas fireplace, which we didn't use since it was warm during our visit, and a balcony. We really enjoyed the indoor heated pool, and used it both nights of our visit. The hotel is very well located on Pittsfield Rd (Route 7), so you are on a major road in the Berkshires and close to pretty much everything in the area. We would definitely recommend the Yankee Inn, especially if you are looking to save some money.

We chose the Yankee Inn based on other TripAdvisor reviews, and were very pleased with our two night stay. Located in Lenox, it was central to our needs. Just a short drive to Pittsfield or Lee for shopping, and, of course, the Norman Rockwell Museum. We stayed in a King bed room with a fireplace and balcony on the third floor of the main building, overlooking the pond and mountains. The room was very clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable we have encountered in our travels. Front desk staff were very courteous and most helpful in providing information about the local and surrounding area's dining and sightseeing locations. Given their reasonable rates, and great customer service, the Yankee Inn is clearly the place to stay.

On par with a Hampton Inn but as the Hampton Inn's seem to be aging, this hotel is staying crisply clean. We stayed in the HOTEL portion and not the motel which I cannot comment upon. Decor: typical, although the furnishings are a darker wood and not modern, it all looks as if it was purchased recently. (that is how impressed I am with the maintenance.) The room has a traditional tv cabinet and not a flat screen. The breakfast area, unlike a Hampton Inn, is not on the main floor but on the room floors in a large room set up exclusively as the eating room.

Positives: Friendly staff, clean, omelets made while you wait.
Negatives: pool smell when you enter the building, no enlargement mirror in bathroom, Poor water pressure (hand held shower helps make up for it so you can actually rinse the shampoo out of your hair.)

I was told that the rooms are about to be updated.

my wife, son and I had a very pleasant ski stay at this decent hotel. What did it was the exceptionally nice and polite staff--Shawn, Kayla and Sean, along with a nice bar lady. Their attentive attitudes made this a great surprise. Although not a luxurious or fancy place, it is quite clean and well kept! We would return again!

'well managed family run hotel in Lenox'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 6, 2012

Howard Johnson Lenox hotel is little beauty in Berkshire County of Massachusetts. View of Berkshire Mountains around the hotel and garden area. I stayed here in handicap room with my husband and had no problem. We were able to easily access all the areas. Microwave and fridge in the room was big relief. AC and internet worked fine. Housekeeping staff did room cleaning time to time. Navin  the guy who manages this hotel is thorough gentleman and soft spoken. This is less pricey and well managed hotel run by happy family.

'You get what you pay for'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed May 28, 2012

We took a motorcycle trip from Florida to Boston this was one of our stops along the way. We initially were placed in room 114. Since it was a warm day we turned on the A/C when we entered the room. It sounded like a diesel truck running. It was an old unit so we tried to see if it was just the casing or cover but neither seemed to be the cause. When the compressor shut off the sound would stop. There were also flies in the room and it had a musty smell to it. We gave the A/C a half hour or so to see if it would quiet down but it didn't. I asked the hotel clerk if we could get another room explaining about the A/C noise. He told me he has had no complaints and we need to adjust the front cover of the A/C and it would quiet down. I explained to him that we tried that and it did not improve. So after much pushing he acquiesced and gave us another room. We ended up in room 104. The A/C unit was newer and much quieter. There were no flies or bad smells. Good size room with an ok bed. There were not enough pillows or blankets. The bathroom was small but clean. The TV was old but large and functioning. The pool was closed and we could see the liner was all torn up so it didn't look like it had been open in a long time yet the billboard out front still advertised a pool. It also advertised HBO but the HBO was not working.

A little dated and unassuming from the outside. Room was comfy. TV was older but plenty of channels. Booked a Jacuzzi suite, and it took a long time to fill up. Not much water pressure or hot water supply to fill the large 2 person tub. But once it was full, it was enjoyable. There are plenty of places to eat right on the same road, and it's a quick drive to the outlets. There is also a quick free breakfast in the morning. The breakfast room is a little small with only 2 tables set out for people who don't want to bring food back outside into their room.

This hotel is in a good location within easy drive from Pittsfield, Stockbridge and Lenox. Rooms are big and comfortable, bathrooms are dated but clean. The staff are friendly and the housekeeping and cleaning staff do an excellent job of keeping things clean and tidy. Overall good value for money and comfortable for a short stay. There is a fridge and microwave in the room for those who prefer to self cater. Breakfast is basic, but adequate for those who prefer not to have a big fry up for breakfast. There is a waffle maker if you want to get fancy, but otherwise you get cereal, bagels, muffins, juice and coffee.

Booked jacuzzi suite for new years eve. Front desk was friendly and got us checked in within 3 minutes or so. Room was clean, although it seemed a bit dated. Tv was old, on off button was broken but the remote control worked. Bathroom very small but clean and functional.
Jacuzzi took a while to fill with hot water but well worth the wait. Bed was comfortable. Overall the room was bigger than I would have expected and I felt it was a very good value for the price. Quick and friendly checkout.
After getting home I realized I left an expensive item in the room and called the motel, and they were nice enough to mail it to me.

This is a straight forward, plain jane motel. It's in good shape, seems to have been done over from some of the older reviews, but it's not the Taj Mahal, but then again, you're not paying for the T.M. Room was nice and large, clean and bed very comfortable and not a bedbug in sight. Wireless worked well in our room as did the micro wave and small fridge. The breakfast was typical and adaquate. Front desk people were nice and friendly. Only problem, on night we arrived, the sink wouldn't drain so rather than wait for next day maintenance or pack up all our stuff and move, we borrowed a plunger and freed up the problem on our own. Location is very good, about halfway between Stockbridge attractions and Mt. Greylock area.

'Just Fine'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed October 5, 2011

This is pretty much exactly what you'd expect for the name & the price. It was clean, the heat & AC worked fine & the bed was pretty comfortable. The Wifi signal in my room wasn't so great is pretty much the only negative I have. And the folks at the front desk made it feel like a pleasantly old-fashioned family-run kind of place. Oh, and housekeeping actually respected my Do Not Disturb sign, which was nice. I'd be fine with staying here again if I were in the area, though it didn't blow me away or anything so if I got a better rate on one of the nearby, similar chains I'd just go with that.

this is a rather typical motel but it is a good option for those on a budget. the lenox area can be very expensive and the motel offered a very reasonable rate with some nice extras including a fridge and microwave in the room and continental breakfast. the management was very nice. the wheelchair accessible room does not have a roll in shower but they did have a tub seat which made the bathroom very functional. Although this place has been recently refurbished it felt a little warn and if you really looked behind the doors, etc it could use a little more cleaning. Overall though it was a good deal for the price. It also does not sit in the historic town but this is only a short drive.

We stayed here for a week and liked it so much that we bought a week. Excellent location, quiet yet close to Lenox, Stockbridge and Pittsfield. Layout is very good, particularly the two bedroom units. Second bedrooms have isolation and private bath. Couches mentioned in other reviews have been replaced. Staff was energetic and responsive. Plenty of hot water and strong water pressure insure a delightful shower. Nice indoor pool, tennis courts, bicycles, paddle boat. Comfortable and relaxing!

'Lovely escape'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed April 28, 2012

The resort is very comfortable, clean, well maintained with very helpful staff. The mattress was uncomfortable and could be firmer. We loved being able to wake up in an apartment setting with the lake and fountain 15 feet from the kitchen. The overall location of the property within the Berkshire Mts could not have been better for us. It is in on the outside of town yet close to 'major' towns and more hiking trails/ parks of all different levels of difficulty/ease. We would stay again in the future but would have to request a firmer mattress.

We stayed here for a girls' weekend and were drawn to this property because of its amenities such as a kitchenette, jacuzzi tub and TV/DVD player. It was great to be able to have breakfast in the room. The grounds were nice. The couches are a bit worn and not particularly comfortable and neither was the bed but that could just as easily be the case in a hotel room as well. We weren't able to take advantage of all of the features the property offers (indoor pool, games, movies available to borrow, etc.) and look forward to taking advantage of them when we have another opportunity to return.

We stayed here last weekend in a 2-bedroom unit to use it as home base for a weekend trip to Butternut. While the unit is technically a sleep-6, we actually had a dozen people (6 adults and 6 children). The unit has 1 bedroom on the first floor, along with a sleeper sofa in the living room; upstairs is another sleeper sofa and a second bedroom. There was plenty of room for everyone since most of the children slept in sleeping bags. Other reviews are correct that the units are dated. However, we found it to be clean, which is most important. The place is a 15 minute drive to Butternut, which is very convenient. The clubhouse has an indoor pool, which the children enjoyed. Wi-fi in the units (unsecured). A few recommendations if you are going to stay here...First, the units have a fireplace in which you are allowed to burn only artificial logs - they sell small 2-hour logs at the front desk for $3 apiece, but you could probably bring better ones to save a little money. Secondly, while the clubhouse provides pool towels, they are small so you may want to bring your own. Lastly, my wife found the sheets to be of low quality - if you want to improve your experience, you may want to bring your own sheets. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would certainly return for another ski weekend.

'Beautiful Grounds, Decent Unit'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed August 23, 2011
3
people found this review helpful

The historic site with its beautiful grounds makes for a wonderful environment. The outdoor pool was lovely, there was a majestic heron sitting on the pond at one point, and we took a walk along Laurel Lake (you have to exit the property to access a laneway down). The units themselves have excellent layout and a clean, well-stocked kitchen (but bring your own supplies, including aluminum foil, etc.) and rooms. Furniture and carpet are dated but clean, bathroom needs a reno but is clean. This place could use a lesson in customer service -- tiny frustrations detract from the pleasure of the stay. E.g., no shampoo in the rooms, and the nearest store requires a trip in the car. Newspaper is not free. We would stay here again as a couple, and would recommend it for young children as there's lots to do. However, older teens may find it dull -- the amenities close at 9:00PM.

'Wonderful trip to the Berkshires'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed August 18, 2011

In planning our trip to the Berkshires, we were looking for a family-oriented place to stay that would be close to major attractions, yet secluded enough to give us some alone time with our new baby (who, heading into the Memorial Day weekend, was only 4 months old). The Ponds at Foxhollow perfectly fit our needs  it was only 5 minutes away from one of the major attractions in the area  the Edith Wharton estate  as well as only 10 minutes away from both Tanglewood and the town of Lenox, which we had always heard was one of the best towns in the Berkshires. (Hint: the Canyon Ranch Spa  typically ranked among the best spas in the nation - is in Lenox)

Foxhollow  which was apparently a former retreat for scions of the great New York City families back in the day (i.e. folks like Edith Wharton)  did not disappoint. We had a two-room condo with a private backyard patio that had a view of a private lake. Within the Foxhollow complex, there was also a pool, a health club and tennis courts, not to mention trails for walking. Foxhollow is itself set far back from the road, and bordered by hedges, trees, and a long, winding path accessible by both car and bike. We loved this privacy and seclusion  but if you're planning on walking to a restaurant  or even to a grocery  late at night you'll be out of luck. You'll need to hop in your car and hit one of the nearby towns  the drive isn't bad at all, but we definitely stocked up on our arrival night with food and beverages.

For a relaxing, scenic stay in the Berkshires, I would readily recommend Foxhollow. The booking system is not Web-enabled, and that gave us cause for concern before arriving, but the staff was extremely helpful (even offering to help us assemble our borrowed baby travel crib). All the amenities were modern, but the charm and feeling of the place hearkened back to an Age of Innocence.

My husband and I travel quite a bit an this place was VERY disappointing. the grounds are beautiful however don't be fooled. The interior of these condos are a trip to 1980. When I called the Gen Manager to complain about the shower head where the water hits your face like bullets, or the fact we were there 2 days yet only got one coffee packet , and you were only allowed 1, thats 1 set of towel for 2 nights, his response was 'oh well'. I mean really.....he was basically like 'too bad.' When I stated my dissatisfaction, he was not willing to help me out. When I stated I was going to write a letter, he said go ahead, its your perogative. REALLY!!! For $300 p/night I expected SO MUCH MORE. I would NEVER stay there again, nor would I recommend it to anyone. I think you would get better service at the Quaiity Inn down the street. Maybe the Gen Manager Ed, should watch the movie 'Give them the Pickle' . Its all about customer service!!!!!!

people found this review helpful

We very much like the Ponds and stay there at least once a year--and we're looking forward to spending more weeks there in the future.

The Ponds consists of two types of units--the Westinghouse units are on the ground floor and sleep up to four. The Vanderbilt units are on the second and third floors and sleep up to six (two bedrooms sleeping two each and the sleeper couch in the living room). Those names fit because the property was once the vacation home of those famous families.

The rooms are spacious and although the counter space in the kitchen area is limited, these are the most fully equipped kitchens we've ever experienced in a timeshare.

The grounds are attractive, especially the "ponds" themselves on which it is possible to row or use a paddleboat. The clubhouse is strikingly beautiful.

The resort did have problems with high speed internet access, but that's been completely resolved and the service is now excellent.

The units are attractive, well appointed and clean, but some aspects of maintenance could be better. For example, the threshold to outside doors may be a bit worn and in the unit we were in the "fit and finish" on a Jacuzzi tub would have been better if finished off with some molding between the tub and the wall.

Lenox is a great location for a wide range of activities throughout the entire year. There are any number of historic properties to visit and during the summer there are a full range of cultural attractions in Lenox (Tanglewood and a Shakespeare program). Edith Wharton's "The Mount" adjoins the Ponds. The Normal Rockwell Museum and Chesterwood (where the model for the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. was crafted) is in nearby West Stockbridge. The Hancock Shaker Village is just a few miles away in Pittsfield along with the home in which Herman Melville wrote "Moby Dick."

Lots of stunning scenery and, of course, during the fall, this is a prime jumping off place to view the foliage and during the winter there is easy access to a number of ski resorts.

4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 29, 2012

Stayed here in May 2012 and thought it was pretty good. The staff was helpful and the room offered Residence Inn standard items like the fridge and kitchen. It isn't luxurious but it is a good value. Breakfast was served and exceeded my expectations in the variety of food that they had. They try to spice up the hotel by adding a bar/lounge but it was empty the whole time, not much mixing and mingling.

The location is nice. It is about 15 min walk to Rodeo Drive. The hallways had a slightly funny smell but enerything was clean and neat.

'Not bad'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 20, 2012

I was recently at a conference and the conference hotel was sold out for the last night. I called Marriott reservations to make a reservation at another property, which was within walking distance from the conference hotel. Other conference attendees were staying at this property. The agent advised me that this property was booked, but the Residence Inn was right across the street. He went on to say that the hotels shared the same parking lot. After checking out of the first hotel, I told the cab driver that he must have taken me to the wrong hotel because this hotel was not walking distance. Well, I was at the right hotel and the reservation agent lied. The front desk person confirmed that I was not given accurate information. I was pressed for time so I checked in to the hotel anyway. My experience at the property was pretty good. The members of the staff were very friendly. My room was clean and spacious. The hotel decor was somewhat dated. However, the breakfast was excellent. Although my bill was credited for one cab ride, I am still very unhappy with Marriott reservations. I skipped the last day of the conference because I did not want to spend additional money on cab fare. I would rather that they not provide any information, if it is going to be inaccurate. However, I am basing my rating on the hotel property, not reservations.

Family and I stayed here for a graduation celebration for 6 nights and very much enjoyed our stay. The rooms were a little smaller than expected but beds were excellent and it was nice to have our own kitchen area. One room was a 1 bedroom suite, the other was a standard room...if you are looking to save a little on cost the standard and 1 bedroom are not all that different except that you can shut the door to the bedroom in the suite for watching tv/sleeping on the couch. Also, a tip, though we did not encounter a problem, if you need quiet to sleep ask for a room that faces the courtyard rather than the street. Location is great--you can walk to great restaurants and Rodeo Drive and the hotel offers a free shuttle within 3 miles. Restaurant Row is also a short cab ride away. Staff was SO pleasant, helpful, and kind--there was no LA attitude here! From check-in to breakfast to check-out to cab service we could not have asked for more attentive staff to assist in making our trip enjoyable and it was so nice to hear "have a nice day!" or "welcome back" after a long day! The small gym was also great with nice, new equipment for vacation workouts. We were thrilled by the great breakfast offered daily with many choices--eggs, breakfast burritos, french toast/pancakes, a waffle maker, coffee, juice, omelette station, yogurt, fruit, etc. It was really excellent and a great cost saver not having to spend $ on breakfast each day. There is also a lobby bar that serves CA wines in the evening which was a nice surprise and Mon-Wed there are appetizers offered in the lobby area. The only thing that would have made the stay perfect is if there was an outdoor pool to enjoy the CA sunshine! We had an excellent stay and would definitely stay at this property again on our next trip to LA--highly recommend!

'Replacement Hotel for Us'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed May 31, 2012

When our original hotel cancelled two nights ahead of our scheduled trip, Days Inn was our replacement hotel. The staff was nice enough, but there were several disappointing issues: We booked two rooms for our large family and they initially tried to put us on opposite sides of the hotel. Easily fixed, but when they gave us rooms right next to one another, one was smaller and smelled very musty, and yet it had a huge tv whereas the cleaner smelling room had a small tv.

The decor was modest and old fashioned, but the room was attended to every day and cleaned by excellent staff. The AC made a lot of noise and kept shutting off. There was no internet in the room, and going to the lobby was not a solid option as it is is very hot there and limited outlets to plug in a laptop; if you needed to work in the am, which I did, the eating/lobby area is too congested and not conducive to getting on internet. The waffle, muffin, bagel breakfast was okay--waffles were the best, but the staff did not keep the area clean enough and if you put your styrofoam plate down, it might come up sticky. Syrup was generic, muffins cold and kind of stale, toaster completely broken, juice machine pumped hot liquid, tea bags were stale and the layout was not conducive for even 12 people to be able to eat; unless they were comfortable sharing tables or knew one another, very few people remained after grabbing a breaded something to eat. Whilst there were apples, which we very good, they were also warm and that was a little disappointing.

The worst part was the shower head that was not positioned above my head and hit my face or neck intsead, and not being able to utilize the pool, which was why I agreed to take this replacement location. We had limited money due to an unexpected emergency before leaving home, so we had to plan our days carefully. We anticipated being able to get on internet in the evening or am and also to swim whilst not seeing a local site--no such luck, which was very frustrating as the temperatures grew quite warm at times, and my young daughter became unquestionably uncomfortable and bored.

Being in the room was okay, but not comfortable for sleeping or extended periods of time, and when we tried to have dinner in the room, we had to bring in two chairs from the adjacent room and it was just ridiculously crowded.

No conditioner or monetary aids were offered other than a mini shampoo and mini soap--not enough for one person for the amount of days we stayed, but luckily we always bring our own and there was a sign stating that if you needed something the hotel would help you get it--this meant giving directions to the local market.

Overall, for the price and location, safety was okay and it was clean enough for us to make our own fun and feel safe leaving our things whilst we toured--would prefer a better place on next travel venture though.

If you only need a quick place that is safe, quiet, and no frills for a cheap price--this is the place.

'Only Option without a 2 night minimum'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed December 9, 2011

In the height of Tanglewood season this is one of your only options without a 2 night minimum. It's good that there is no minimum because you don't want to stay more than a night. There is nothing "wrong," but there is nothing good either. It's a fine place to sleep and shower after Tanglewood but you won't want to do anything else in the dingy rooms.

We had asked ahead for a quiet room, and they were very accomodating in putting us in the back facing the forest with nobody in the rooms above us. Decent room reasonably clean, no smoke odor, nice value. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Washer and dryer was on the fritz and so we went down to the laundramat behind Carl's Jr, one of the most awful broken-down dumps I've ever been to. Save your laundry for somewhere else.

I stayed at this motel for 2 nights over Labor Day. It is located between the towns of Lenox and Pittsfield MA, but close to the tourist towns of Lee and Stockbridge. The setting is lovely, off the road on a hill, spacious grounds with a pool and a picnic area. There is a mountain view from the parking lot. The room was large, clean and comfortable, very quiet sleeping. The hotel is an easy drive to the many attractions in the area, but the country setting provides a peaceful retreat from the busyness of the tourist towns. One must drive for meals, but the on-site breakfast is good and several restaurants will deliver meals. I was tired on my arrival and the desk clerk suggested I try one. I did and the meal was delicious.
The room had microwave, refridgerator and coffee maker so it is possible to do light meals on your own. All in all very comfortable and a very good value. I will be visiting this area in the future and will choose this motel again.

'Basic, no frills, good for a stop over'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed April 8, 2012

person found this review helpful

I stopped here for a night when passing through. What you get is exactly what they say. A bed, a fridge, TV, WiFi, a bathroom, and that's about it.

There's no microwave nor is there in-room coffee - and that's as advertised. There is coffee in the office but it's that slightly dark-brown warm water that comes out of a pot marked coffee but doesn't actually taste much of coffee, or anything. Someone else mentioned the paper-thin walls. Oh yes, you most certainly can hear the conversations of your neighbors.

On the downside, the extractor fan in the bathroom rattled so much that it sounded like a jumbo jet so I was thankful for the ability to turn on the light by the bathroom mirror. The sheets on my bed were somewhat rough to; perhaps over-bleached, perhaps just cheap. Again, this is a budget motel and if you're expecting more then you'd be in the wrong market segment.

If you are simply looking for a bed for the night, then this is a viable option. If you prefer your comforts and a little more style, then you might want to pay a little extra and move up-market instead.

Would I come back? Maybe.

The lenox inn fits the bill for an affordable stay in the berksires. The motel is close to many fine restaurants, tanglewood, skying, shopping and other tourist spots. The beds are very comfortable. The room has a desk, two chairs, great tub shower combo. as for the general cleanliness of the room, I did find a hair on the bathroom floor and some kind of a web in the corner of the room. I travel often and have seen these things in five star hotels. Not a big deal.bottom line is that you wont go wrong at the lenox inn.

'"You Get What You Pay For" Comes to Mind'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed February 22, 2012

I rated the Lenox Inn three stars solely based on its affordable rates and the bang-for-buck factor. The "you get what you pay for" expression comes to mind.

Don't come to this motel if you're a germaphobe because the place wouldn't pass your standards. The room's odor alone will knock you off your feet.

Also, don't stay here if you care at all that others can hear your in-room conversations and activities--yes, all of them! The walls are so paper thin that my niece, staying in the adjoining room, was able to recite word-for-word what I'd been talking about.

'wouldn't stay again'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed December 16, 2011

I'm submitting this review because in my experience this week the motel is highly overrated on all of the sites I checked. The stay wasn't a disaster, but I wouldn't want to repeat it. The place isn't very clean--during my usual bedbug check, I discovered lots of uncleaned corners, including lots of hair and dirt between the mattress and bedspring on the bedspring cover, which looked like it hadn't been washed in ages. There was also hair on the back of the toilet. The room smelled like chemical air fresheners. The motel rooms are very near a busy road and the sound of passing cars was constant throughout the night (as were sounds from people in the room next door). The proprietor kept talking on the phone while checking me in, and couldn't be bothered to recommend a local restaurant. Also, there was no latch on the inside of the door to the room, which generally makes me feel less safe. I really don't understand the good reviews that have been written!

The clerk at check-in was professional. The room was mostly clean. There was mold starting to grow on the shower curtain. For a one-night stay it was fine. The room was very small. Old appliances. An even older TV. We stayed in a room with two double beds which was situated towards the back of the property so we didn't hear the traffic.There were numerous "unsavory" characters staying there. I felt uncomfortable and made sure the windows were locked and even put a chair and the cooler in front of the door. The WiFi was slow. It was okay for what we paid. We paid $55 including tax.

'Good Value...good stay..'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed October 30, 2011

For $50 and the name "wagon wheel, with a white cement horse out front, we were sceptical ... I have never stayed in a motel this "cheap"... but after reading trip advisor reviews we decided to give it a try.

It was fine...room was clean, king size bed was very comfortable. TV was old..but had cable, -- nothing fancy. Staff was friendly ... I went to the small office for coffee a little late, the manager said he would brew me some...called my room it 5 minutes for coffee. Next door is a very good Irish pub and some shopping across street and a wine store within a block.

We would stay again... a great stop-over on a trip.

'Not as Bad as you might think...'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed October 5, 2011

When I was looking for a room in the area, I was astonished at the expensive rates at similar hotels in the vicinity. The Wagon Wheel was 60 dollars, and was incredibly worth the cost. The room we got (king size) was well cleaned, nicely furnished and exactly what we were looking for. The hotel is very close to several restaurants within walking distance, close to attractions like Arrowhead, The Mount, et cetera as well as Pittsfield and southern Berkshire County. If you looking for pomp and frills you probably won't like this hotel - but it's a terrific place for a good deal.

'Pleasantly surprising budget motel'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed September 6, 2011

We were a little skeptical when we drove up to this motel. It is right on the road and seems dated. Our room was extremely clean, nicely furnished and very comfortable beds. Everything was in good repair. The family owners were warm,friendly and welcoming. The free coffee in the lobby included dunkin donuts munchkins. Our room was in the rear section, which was lovely. The large grassy area had a few picnic tables and was great for early morning coffee. I would not hesitate to stay here again. We left smiling.

'Well, it IS CHEAP! But, that is about all I can say'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed August 16, 2011

OK, maybe the location is wonderful, for all the Berkshire sights and sounds. But, it is a really down and out motel from the old days. Complete with a replica of Roy Roger's horse in the front.... well, maybe it wasn't Trigger, but it could have been. There is fresh paint around the place. The clientele seem to working stiffs and cheap vacationers. This is the sort of motel that often houses "homeless" people... but, I saw little evidence of that sort of thing. The rooms were clean and tacky decor abounds. Even though it is on a major thoroughfare... the room we had at the back wasn't noisy. I would be cautious with security issues. Use your common sense.

'Not the Ritz but did not expect it to be- No Frills'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed August 17, 2009

This hotel is small, no frills, & met our basic needs. Had difficulty finding hotel availability during a recent Tanglewood visit & decided to stay here. We were not expecting anything elaborate - nor was it. We had a quiet room in the back. It was small, dated, but clean - also had minifridge /microwave. Two people could not fit in the bathroom at the same time if they tried. One nite is just fine. Close to Tanglewood. 10% discount to local restaurants. I would not recommend the front rooms facing the street - I'm sure far too noisy. Owners were extremely pleasant.

'Absolutely Fabulous!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed July 30, 2009

This is a charming, quaint motel -- clean, attractive. An extremely kind family runs the place, so you get a very at-home feeling here. I stayed for three nights, and was happy here the entire time. The bed was comfy and I slept really well. I'm happy to say the windows are like windows in a real house -- they open! There are lots of restaurants nearby, all within walking distance, as well as one of the nicest grocery stores I have ever been in called Guido's (a five-minute walk). A Chinese restaurant and a Friendly's, a CVS and a Price Chopper are just across the road. I could easily have stayed here longer. Also: I spent almost the entire two days in my room (was finishing some work) and I didn't feel claustrophobic at all. The rooms smell nice, too. (Microwave, TV, small fridge included.)

I had stayed here once before, several years ago, and found it satisfactory for my needs. It is a bit run down, but the rooms have all the 'stuff' you might want, and the staff is very accommodating. The landscaping is quite wonderful! Nicely located outside of 'Historic Lenox' on Rt 7 - easy to get around, and close enough to everything without a big traffic problem. For a one night stay in this high-end neighborhood, I would recommend it to anyone.

Don't ever stay at this hotel. Very dirty, poor customer service and poor accomodation. The AC and heating unit not working, the BR commode yellowish in color, the key pad not working. We did not have a key to enter the room, the owner has to unlock the door every time we have to enter. The lights in the room not working. When you bring all these problems to the owner, they will just say that they did not have any other room to move you, they just don't care.

Visited the Berkshires during January 2012. Off season, it was a delight to see the mountains, during a beautiful snow event, with the luxury of NO CROWDS! The Econo Lodge is well located and only 10 minutes from almost anything you want to do in this area, including the Norman Rockwell museum, Kirpalu, and lots of hiking. The rates were dirt cheap.

The room had a micro wave and little fridge. The wifi signal was to weak in our room, #137, so NO INTERNET access. The room was clean and no frills. While it had everything we needed it was badly out of date. The beds were passably comfortable, but very old. There was junk in the hallways by the ice machine.

The hotel staff was nice enough.

While I was comfortable enough in the hotel and very much enjoyed the trip to Berkshires, I would have to say this hotel is a clean dive. The no wifi is a concern.

My experience was I was stranded in Lenox in a horrible snowstorm and could not find a place to stay because I was traveling with 2 cats.

I finally saw a bright Econo Lodge sign and stopped the car at the foot of the driveway - I wasn't sure I could drive the car up the hill, and the snow was falling so fast I couldn't see anything. I finally reached the lobby, shaking from the cold and fear of driving on glare ice for hours. I confessed to having cats, but the man at the desk just said "I will help you." I almost cried. He offered to drive my car up the hill, gave me a room on a courtyard away from the wind, and actually unloaded my bags from the car, cats and all.

There were other stranded travelers there that night, and the next morning there was a nice breakfast (free) in a diningroom with waffles, juice, pastries and hot coffee. It was wonderful.

I can't thank Econo Lodge enough. The room was very clean, with a great TV.

I would definitely stay there again -- on a vacation next time I hope.

'Amazing Grace at Liberty Hill Inn'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 16, 2012

The loss of my 89 year old mother brought my entire family of 12, plus many more friends and extended family, to Yarmouthport in January 2012. We were most fortunate to be able to have the graciousness of the entire Liberty Hill Inn plus the Guest House for a long week-end. John was alone as Kris was in the East visiting family. His generosity, consideration, flexibility and kindness were shining examples of "Grace under pressure." He provided for us, he tended to us, he overextended himself and he made us feel as though we were home basking in the warmth of our own homes. Words cannot express my and my families heartfelt appreciation for all of his understanding and support. We have been frequent visitors to this charming Inn and I can heartily endorse every aspect of hospitality extended by the Inn Keepers...Impeccably clean, outstanding food, and especially the cookie jar by the front door! Super Service!! We look forward to our next visit.

Innkeepers should visit here to see how it's done. You can feel that John and Kris have made it their personal mission to make sure that your stay is perfect, but somehow manage to do that while having everything be low key and unpretentious. No detail is overlooked. They greet you with a glass of wine (and there is more in the fridge to help youself if you want), the rooms are beautiful, the breakfast is fabulous, the cookies in the cookie jar are homemade and delicious, there is a gorgeous salt marsh less than a mile away...

We came in shoulder season, and they were very accommodating even though we only had one night. The room was everything I had hoped for, meeting expectations even after reading all the excellent reviews here. What we really put it over the top for me were glasses of wine when we came in; the amazing jacuzzi tub in our room (Elridge); and the fresh cookies Kris made which were in a jar in the hallway. Bed, breakfast... and cookies. The breakfast was excellent, too! (See other reviews.) I wish we could have stayed much longer. We didn't have much time to socialize, but my strong impression was that you could have both quiet time to yourself / -selves and fun social time with the owners and other guests, as you liked.

We had no idea what to expect when we booked this at the last minute to spend a night away. The minute we met Denise, we knew we were going to a wonderful place. Beautiful main house with comfortable and welcoming rooms to sit, relax and enjoy a sip of sherry. Our room was away from the main house and was quiet and beautifully done. Best of all, the breakfast- as my husband said- If breakfast was this good, we have to come back for another night and have dinner! I shouldn't tell you all this because we will never get in again- they'll be all booked!

'A lovely B&B in Lenox - it deserves its' high ratings!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 18, 2012
1
person found this review helpful

My husband and I spent Mother's Day weekend at this lovely B&B. We've been to Lenox 50 times at least over the years, and never stayed here. But we've stayed at many other Lenox B&B's so I think we have a good sense of comparison. We stayed in Room #1 in the main house. For those not used to old B&B's, this is an OLD house (think 18th c.) so don't expect the W Hotel. Rooms can be funky and ceilings low and bathrooms small. If you understand antique houses, you'll be happier. That being said, the bed was COMFORTABLE - something we never take forgranted anymore and have, in fact, stopped going to several B&B's because they don't understand that charm isn't everything - sleeping is important also! Both the terrific breakfast and the gorgeous grounds make this place heavenly. Walking into town is a delight. The innkeepers are helpful as can be and the chocolate chip cookies are lethal! Try it. You'll like it!

'Perfect Anniversary Getaway'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 18, 2012

As we approached our 40th wedding anniversary we found the Garden Gables Inn was featured on SniqueAway, TripAdvisor's sister site. After reading the excellent reviews and viewing the photos we thought we found the perfect quick getaway. We were not disappointed. We were greeted at the door by the owner John who gave us a tour of the inn as he led us to our room, #15. The innkeeper, Denise, was on vacation and John stepped in as chef for breakfast which was wonderful. Not only would we love to return, we are purchasing a gift certificate for friends for their anniversary.

'Sweet Stay at the Garden Gables Inn'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed April 12, 2012
5
people found this review helpful

My husband and I stayed here in February. It's a wonderful inn, and Denise is the best innkeeper. She's friendly and welcoming and at the same time, gives you your space - and to top it off, she's an excellent chef! Because it was a long drive for us, I booked us the 'chef's table' at the Inn for our first night's dinner and I'm so happy I did, dinner was delicious! My husband had to refrain from licking his plate - and the dessert was a perfect sweet ending: homemade lemon pound cake with fresh whipped cream, lemon curd and berries.

I would absolutely stay here again. The only negatives during our stay were:

We stayed in a large room (#15) but the bathroom could use a little sprucing up. I assumed the 'whirlpool' tub would be a large tub but it's just a regular tub with whirlpool jets and the bathroom is so dark, I really didn't feel like soaking. It could use a little renovating.

Also my husband and I booked massages, and (unfortunately I can not remember the name of the man who was our massage therapist) but hands-down the WORST massage either of us has ever had! I get massages often, I was surprised that I wasn't told or asked upon booking if a male masseuse would be okay with me (kinda not) and when I was chatting with him, I asked "how long have you been doing massage" and he said 7 years. There's just no way this guy has been a professional massage therapist for 7 years. He used almost no pressure, even though I kept saying "you can use more pressure"; there was no skill or technique or type of style (swedish, shiatsu, etc) and I kept waiting for him to get started but in the end it was just a really annoying, disappointing experience - waste of time and money. My husband was equally underwhelmed with his massage. So just a head's up.

My husband and I recently visited Lenox and chose the Garden Gables Inn because of the reviews on tripadvisor, and they were right on! The house is absolutely beautiful, well maintained, immaculate, and rich with history and original detail. We stayed in room 9 and it was fantastic! Beautiful decor and bedding, definitely made us feel right at home. Denise, the inn keeper was great. Her cooking was amazing! From the french toast breakfasts to the fresh cookies (available all the time), we definitely did not go hungry. Garden Gables Inn was the best choice we could have made for our first trip to the Berkshires, and we'll definitely go back to our home away from home!

We spent a weekend at the Garden Gables Inn and as beautiful as the Berkshires are, we didn't feel like leaving the inn. The beds, linens and towels made getting up each morning difficult, and the main motivation was the scrumptious breakfast! Comfortable sitting areas made for perfect read and relax areas and the unforgettable chocolate chip cookies Denise made gave us more reason to stay put!

My husband and I's recent vacation in Lenox will always be memorable due to our stay at the Garden Gables Inn. The owner, John greeted us with a warm welcome and a helping hand with our bags. Denise, the innkeeper provided for a comfortable stay with pampering as if we were staying in a family member's home. Being a french trained chef, Denise served us amazing breakfasts and the BEST EVER chocolate chip cookies! The inn itself is beautiful and we very much enjoyed our fireplace room while laying in bed looking out at falling snow. We looked forward to coming home in the evenings and sipping the Harney and Sons teas offered. Lenox is a charming town and the local dining was excellent! Denise's recommendation for a special dinner at the Old Inn on the Green was wonderful. It was a step back in time, a former stagecoach relay, and unique experience to dine by fireside and cande light with no electricity in the dining rooms. We will never forget our memorable week in the Berkshires and will definitely return to the Garden Gables!

5 of 5 stars Reviewed March 2, 2012

Once again the Garden Gables B&B delivered. Comfort, cleanliness, friendliness, service, delicious breakfast, service, management, caring and professional wait staff, and beauty...all 5Star. The four of us have toured practically every B&B in the Lenox area and after finding the Garden Gables only last year, we have settled on what we rate as the BEST B&B in the Berkshires. After a new Inkeeper took over, we were unneccessairily apprehensive that the best run inn might change. It remains the very best. This year we decided to try a suite, The Hilltop Orchard, which gave us a beautiful, comfortable space for talk, good times and sleep. The beds were absolutely perfect..like the gift of champagne. Thank you. We will be back next year.

We could not have been happier with our stay at The King's Inne! We had never stayed at a B&B and were not sure what to expect. Paul and Carina were wonderful hosts. They were warm, friendly, and informative.

The description 'Old English' on the website fits this place perfectly. Very cute. The landscaping on the grounds is so lovely, it looks like a post card. The Kensington Suite was very up to date, while keeping the cozy old fashioned feel you look for in a B&B. The layout was very roomy. Perfect room for women to get ready ingreat lighting, multiple outlets, awesome vanity.

We were a bit nervous about the cat, being an allergic couple, but we had absolutely no issues. We would definitely go back.

I have stayed in B and B's in Europe and in the US, and the King's Inne is one of the nicest, if not the nicest I have ever stayed in. Carina and Paul are wonderful hosts and more than accommodating. The rooms were all tastefully appointed, and the bedding in the room we stayed in was unbelievable. It was hard to get out of bed in the morning! The breakfasts that Paul prepared were gourmet, very filling with a presentation so wonderful you hesitated before diving in. The setting surrounding the King's Inn is beautiful with walks immediately outside the door that are the ultimate Cape Cod experience- the ocean with salt marshes, beautiful trees and flowers, wonderful old style Cape Cod homes, a quaint thatched roof barn, not to mention the beautiful gardens that Paul has created on the grounds of the King's Inne. I can't say enough about how fantastic our stay was, and we so look forward to returning to the King's Inne.

'A MUST STAY B&B on Cape Cod - Simply THE BEST!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 9, 2012 NEW

After a long and painful research on TA, I ended up calling the owners of King's Inne (thanks to all wonderful reviews!). Once I have heard Paul's kind and full of British accent voice answering all my questions with confidence and patience (I asked some silly ones, I am sure) -> I was charmed and assured that my special weekend (it was my hubby's birthday) will be spent at exactly this B&B on Cape Cod.

And how RIGHT I WAS!! We arrived on Friday, when the weather was as perfect as it gets, and Paul was waiting for us in front of the house, as if we were old friends and he was excitedly waiting for our arrival. The garden was shining in its perfect shape welcoming us too. Then a beautiful smiling lady, Carina, with the same charming British accent came downstairs to greet us and show us around. We all were chatting as if we knew each other for at least 10 years!

The house is a historical property on the historical route 6A - that is already a jewel by itself, but once we walked in, our breath was taken away: every solid detail of old school British culture mixed with New England charms was present in this house and we felt welcomed fully.

It was supposed to be raining on Saturday and Paul kindly advised us on our plans adjustments for Friday and Saturday- and we were grateful as the rain came down on Saturday indeed. Carina was advising on where to go to feel "local" sense of Cape Cod, what not to miss and where to dine... Simply unbelievable hospitality and welcome! I do not recall such personal attention and participation anywhere - and we travel a lot!

The room was spacious and spotless, the bed was as comfortable as it gets, the decor was rich, solid and to our taste. We stayed in Kensington room upstairs and enjoyed every single detail of it. The colors were so pleasant that we were waking up smiling every morning. My favorite part of the room was the old school beautiful bath-tab - one can never get enough relaxation while taking it ! Highly recommended room indeed and those little details are to die for !

Breakfasts - yam - so tasty and so big that we could not resist those homemade blueberry muffins and absolutely melting in mouth egg benedicts. We were looking forward to our breakfasts every morning! And the 'sun-rise' drink  simply great!

We will be back - surely! And we keep on recommending to our friends to go too! In fact we did not want to leave on Sunday, when we felt three days were too short and we need at least a week to enjoy the King's and the Cape.

We cannot have enough words to thank Paul and Carina - the best innkeepers we have ever met! Thank you and all the very best to you and the greatest success to the Inne!

'Great B&B on Cape Cod'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 31, 2012

Via a strange route I found the King's Inne. At 6'5" tall my husband requires a king size bed. I had no idea how difficult it would be to find one on Cape Cod. But with a lot of research and help from Trip Advisor I was able to find the King's Inne and oh what a find! Paul and Carina are hosting the most wonderful B&B on the Cape. Paul calls himself a cook but he really is a chef in disguise. He makes the most amazing breakfasts ever. His morning fruit plate is so beautiful that you don't really want to eat it but are forced to because it looks so tasty. He makes a blueberry muffin to die for; if I were a blueberry this is the way I would want to go. He really knows how to cook bacon and his egg dishes are just wonderful. We stayed there for 6 nights and each breakfast was a treat. Carina is a wonderful hostess and is just full of information about the area. She was a big help as we tried to pack in as much sight seeing as possible while we were on the Cape. When she suggests a town or restaurant you need to listen to her. The room we had was just lovely and certainly a place where you can relax and wind down after a busy day. They have a lovely little closet in the dining room where water and drinks can be found (we're big H2O fans) around the clock. They also have umbrellas on the ready should the weather not be as accommodating as it was for us. Paul and Carina maintain a beautiful garden and I learned a lot from Paul on the care and feeding of plants and flowers. The B&B is small (only 3 rooms) which means a lot of individual attention (if you want it). We met some very interesting people while we were there. The Inne is centrally located so we had no problem getting to either the upper or lower Cape; Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard. They are a 5-10 minute drive to Hyannis where you can catch ferries to the islands. If you are on the Cape, please do not hesitate to stay with Paul and Carina, it will be a stay you won't forget!

'Beautiful B&B, Great Location in Cape Cod'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 12, 2012 NEW

We stayed at the Blushing Oyster B&B during Memorial Day weekend, 2012. It was our first trip to Cape Cod and we picked a perfect central location. It was very easy to get around and explore the nearby towns and beaches. Our host, Jim, was warm and welcoming. He gave us great local advice and let us borrow beach chairs, which were put to good use!

The Inn was clean and well cared for. We stayed in the Blue Point room which was private and beautifully decorated. Breakfast was served outdoors on the patio overlooking the garden blooming with fresh flowers. We enjoyed Greek yogurt with fresh fruit and home made granola, and a delicious egg souffle with tomato and goat cheese. A great start to the day!

After spending a day on the beach in nearby Wellfleet, we returned to our room and were delighted to find a bottle of chardonnay on ice waiting for us -- that was a perfect touch!

I highly recommend the Blushing Oyster Inn and would definitely stay there again.

Sorry for the late review- we stayed here last June but if you are reading this now and wondering where to book for your trip in a months` time-don`t hesitate. We stayed in the Blue Point room which was beautifully decorated. The B&B overall was really tastefully decotrated, we had teh garden to ourselves to enjoy home cooked breakfasts in (and the quality and variety of food was fantastic). The owner Jim greeted us with glasses of wine on arrival and was great for local advice while we were there. There is a good restaurant about 50 meters down the road and all of teh sights of Cape Cod are within easy reach. I`d recommend this place to anyone, but especially couples who are looking for a classy, cosy place for a getaway.

While traveling on a quick trip to the Cape for a business conference I was very pleased to have a chance to stay at the Blushing Oyster. I had but one evening and morning to indulge in a calm, comfortable and pleasant stay. Jim was very helpful and available to my questions and needs. The Inn is beautifully decorated with special attention given to it's place in history and region. I had a full breakfast that was expertly prepared, with the very important "good coffee". I also loved meeting Alice the dog, who was very welcoming as well. I recommend staying at The "Oyster" and will welcome the opportunity to visit again.

'Gorgeous place to stay: highly recommend'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed November 19, 2011

Even though we own a cottage and a house on the Cape and we have lots of family here we could stay with, I wanted a B&B experience for my birthday. My husband made a very good choice in the Blushing Oyster. I was thrilled! I am very picky and already know a lot about the Cape. Some places on the Cape (especially cottages and hotels) have terrible beds and furniture and smell like mold and mildew. A B&B is the way to go and this one is especially nice. The home is beautifully restored/decorated and they have kept some very authentic Cape Cod touches. While having some modern luxuries (comfy bed, fluffy towels, modern bath, etc.) and beautiful decor, you still have the feel of a period house. We had a suite on the main floor which was spacious and had an electric fireplace and also a huge tub (Wellfleet). We stayed during the week and people who live on the Cape need to go to work so 6A can be a busy road even in November. It did not keep us from sleeping--just something to note if you are a very light sleeper and want to sleep in during the week- you may wish to choose a room on the back of the house. We are early risers, so not an issue for us. All of their rooms are lovely so whichever one you pick, you just can't go wrong. We had a sitting area where we could work on our computer and watch TV. I borrowed a book from their library and read it, which was fun. They also have movies you can watch. I read a review of his B&B here that said the staircase is a bit steep. Steep staircases are authentic to Cape houses. This staircase is not as steep as most houses I've visited on the Cape--so disregard that person's comment unless you have some kind of physical disability, in which case just stay on the main floor at any Cape house. You really want to have the real, authentic Cape Cod experience as part of your trip to the Cape so enjoy the stairs as part of that. Breakfast was delicious each day (we really loved the sweet potato pancakes and also the baked pear!) and the coffee was very good. Jim was a lot of fun to visit with. Sue is a sweetheart. The stay at the B&B was a surprise for me so I did not book and had not read the policies. My husband worked in the hotel industry for years and didn't realize we needed to be timely for check in or else call. Even though we disregarded a policy (whoops!), Sue was very sweet when we checked in. We felt badly about it, but they were very nice and accomodating. We stayed in November during very misty, chilly weather and the inn was warm, charming and a wonderful place to come to at night. Each room has its own temperature control, which is not the norm on the Cape and you will enjoy being in control of your room temp. when staying here. By the way, the Cape is a great getaway in November. It's quiet, there is no traffic and you can see a lot more in less time. Many places are closed, but some great shops and places to eat are still open. People who don't come to the Cape in the fall and at Christmas time are missing out. It's not just for summer anymore. Even though we live where it is warm and lovely in November, we come every year in November for my birthday getaway and are now thinking about adding December to our yearly pilgrimages. My best friend and I are coming back to the Cape for a girl's weekend in April, as well. We would definitely stay at this property again. Enjoy!

No need to look any further for a play to stay. This Bed and Breakfast is CLEAN, classy, very comfortable and accommodating as well as centrally located making it convenient to everything. The breakfasts are "over the top" (especially the creme brulee french toast) and the owners, Sue and Jim, truly make you feel right at home. This is a top notch B&B that Sue and Jim have turned into a home away from home. I can't wait to return.

This is just the most perfect Bed and Breakfast ever, full of charm and warmth. Brian is a wonderful and helpful host, upon checking in he takes time to sit down with you and after asking what you want to do goes over a map showing you where things are located and providing useful information on "must does" that you might not have been aware of. His breakfasts are delicious and huge, he is a 5 starl cook. The lemon zest pancakes are to die for.You feel you are visiting an old friend. There are several common areas and a library full of wonderful books and Cape Cod resources. The rooms each have their own personality, and coziness. My favorite the Yarmouth with a 4 poster, huge bathroom and a jacuzzi . The Crook jaw is perfectly located easy to all Cap Cod attaractions and as a bonus in walking distance from the Yarmouth Inn , an excellent restaurant. You can't go wrong choosing to stay here. I was with friends from the UK and they loved it too.

We rented the whole Crrok Jaw Inn for our wedding weekend to put up our wedding party/family. To say we loved it would be a major understatement. Brian made us feel so at home, we all felt like we could just move right in!
Fresh hot coffee was always on first thing in the morning. Breakfast was like eating out at a 5 star restaurant. The rooms were spotless, beds comfy and each room has its own personality that just couldn't be beat. The whole inn had so much charm and character I feel like in 3 nights, I still didn't get to take it all in! My husband and I will definately come back here.

'Breakfast was fantastic'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed September 20, 2011

This was our first visit to Cape Cod and we spent 3 nights at Crook Jaw Inn with close friends. Our room (Sea Breeze) was extremely comfortable, bathroom small but very good shower. Brian is the perfect host. My partner is a fussy eater and Brian couldn't have been more helpful in providing him the breakfast he wanted. We were too full to eat the daily home baked muffins, but Brian packaged them up and we ate them during the days exploring Cape Cod. Brian was full of great advice about restaurants and places to visit and as the previous reviewer has already said a born B & B owner. Crook Jaw is a lovely home, where we felt extremely comfortable coming back from a long day, watching one of many DVDs in the spacious lounge area or sitting in the garden reading our books. Perfectly located in Yarmouth for visiting all areas nearby. If we ever get back to the Cape would have no hesitation in staying with Brian at Crook Jaw Inn again. Thank you Brian for making our first visit to Cape Cod so enjoyable.

'Been looking for a B&B like this'

I spend a few days down the Cape each summer with a dear out of town friend and am always looking for that ideal B&B after the one we used to stayed at in Yarmouthport closed over 4 years ago. We finally found it. We had stayed at the Crook Jaw over 10 years ago .... several owners prior to Brian taking over. He has done such a wonderful job with this inn. After visiting B&Bs on Cape Cod for over 20 years, some people are meant to own a B&B and some aren't. Brian is definately a true B&B owner. His decorating touches as well as delicious breakfasts are reason to return year after year. The extra touches----fridge full of water & sodas, wine glasses, beach chairs and towels, fresh baked cookies in the afternoon, etc. are reason to return year after year. Look forward to seeing you again in 2012, Brian. Thanks for an enjoyable weekend.

Brian is a gracious host who provides great advice for sightseeing and dining. He also provides a superb breakfast each morning that includes fresh ingredients. We stayed in the Falmouth Room and found it to be just perfect for a romantic getaway. This room has a four poster bed, a large bathroom with jacuzzi and matching bathrobes. The inn has a very cozy living room where my husband and I enjoyed resting and enjoying a hot cup of coffee each morning before we began sightseeing. The Crook Jaw is located in a quaint little town that has sidewalks so we also enjoyed leisurely strolls during our down time. We look forward to staying at the Crook Jaw Inn again next year!

We stayed here for 3 nights as a little getaway from the daily grind. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly and offered lots of great tips for our stay (where to eat, beach, etc.). Daily breakfasts were enormous and absolutely delicious. There is a large common area, as well as a tv room/library, and we relaxed in the common space on the first night over a bottle of wine. The place is adorable and has all of the charm you could hope for in a New England B&B.

We had the room with the jacuzzi-wouldn't recommend the extra expense, as the tub is tiny and for one person only. The bed in that particular room also has very creaky posts and is right next to the common area...you see where I am going.

The Crook Jaw is right across from a great restaurant called the Old Yarmouth Inn. Delicious seafood, and you can get a little toasted and walk back to the Inn.

We would for sure stay again.

'A quaint Cape Cod experience'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed August 7, 2011

Just got back from our 5 night stay at this B&B run by Brian. The moment we checked in Brian was a most hospitable host, recommending sites to see and places to eat. Never having been to the Cape we found his suggestions to be most helpful. I was glad I decided to choose the location of Yarmouth Port as our home base for the 5 day tour. The Main St. location is also known as the Old King's Highway and the homes have all been preserved and no lit signs are permitted so the area is very residential and relatively quiet. It is centrally located to visit the other towns on the cape. Brian will give you beach chairs and towels to take along to the myriad of beaches in the area.
Brian prepares mouth=watering breakfasts each morning and serves them in the small dining area right off his kitchen. This is a small inn with only 5 rooms. We stayed in the Captain Crocker room, the only room with a king bed. My suggestion - if you must have a king bed then by all means this room will be fine. The drawback,however, is the very small bathroom. It is literally the size of a small closet; just room enough for a sink and toilet opposite and a very small shower. Being up in a dormer-type room the in-room air conditioner and fan really had to work to keep the room cool. If you don't mind a queen bed, try to get the Yarmouth room on the main floor - big bathroom and very nicely appointed. The other rooms upstairs are also very nicely decorated and all had bigger bathrooms than ours.
The location, cleanliness, hospitality, and the value all made this location an excellent choice. I would definitely stay here again.

I am not always a big fan of B&B's but my partner found this Inn when I wanted to get away for a couple of days after having to cancel a weeklong vacation due to a death in the family. The Inn was lovely! The owners have done a wonderful job of renovating and updating this property and their British & European touches make it even more special. You can tell that they love the Inn and I suspect some bad experiences with past guests have led them to request a level of respect from current guests, do not take offense as I see some other reviewers have (negative reviews from 2008).
Everything here is 1st class, including the breakfasts and I recommend the Inn to all. I also recommend the Old Yarmouth Inn next door for dinner.

We enjoyed a perfect spring weekend at this lovely and impeccably maintained inn. The rooms are tastefully renovated and beautifully furnished. I am very picky about bedding and the linens and pillows were also high quality. The bathrooms are also very nice and spacious.
The real charm of the inn are the gracious hosts who really want you to feel like you are a guest in their home. You have the run of several of the downstairs rooms with fireplaces and current magazines and a gorgeous veranda. Homemade cookies and tea are laid out in the late afternoon.
Don't miss Helene's breakfast! I am not much of a breakfast eater but her breakfast, which changes daily was creative, freshly prepared and beyond good. If you have no room for her scone at the end, take it with you for later. I was glad I did because it was the best scone I have ever tasted.
I will definitely be back to this inn. I live in the Boston area and have stayed in many NE inns and this one was really special.

We can thoroughly recommend The Inn at Cape Cod for those wanting a truly unique and personal service. This was our ninth and last hotel in a three week tour of New England. The other hotels were of a high standard but often lacked the personal touch desired by the discerning guest. On arrival at the Inn at Cape Cod we were greeted by a charming miniature White House'. The interior was finished to a very high standard, each room different in style. Indeed the whole atmosphere is most welcoming and relaxing. Housekeeping was of the highest standard. A charming library also provided excellent facilities for guests to prepare beverages. Breakfast can be enjoyed on the terrace and consists of carefully prepared and beautifully presented dishes which are different each day. Everything is homemade and freshly made from high quality ingredients. Mike and Helen, the proprietors, and the staff are happy to help guests with advice on sightseeing, trips or venues for evening meals. We would certainly make The Inn at Cape Cod our first choice on another visit to the Cape.

What a beautiful Inn. We staying in the Plantation Suite and had lots of room and a lovely balcony. We were greeted by Mike on arrival and shown around the Inn. There is a lovely sitting room and a kitchenette area next to the breakfast room, which has lovely fresh coffee and home made cookies available during the day and evening. Although there is not the option of an evening meal there are plenty of choices nearby. We chose to eat at the Inn opposite which has a tavern and a separate dining room both with a very good menu. It was 2 minutes walk so no trouble at all if you did not want to drive out in the evening. Breakfast was delicious. Helen and Mike served you - no self service. There was the option of fresh fruit juices, tea and coffee, fresh fruit, different types of cereal (Helen's home made granola was really tasty), following by a cooked dish (always something different) and then a homemade cake to finish. Breakfast was so filling we ended up taking the cakes with us for a snack later in the day ... and very nice and welcome they were too.

Mike takes a lot of time and trouble to explain the area, if you want, and he gave us lots of different options of what we could do. Nothing seemed too much trouble. He booked tickets for us over to Nantucket island, provided us with maps and directed us to the best parking. Mike is a wealth of knowledge and enthusiasm.

We have stayed in numerous hotels around the world and I can honestly say that we have never received such excellent hospitality and friendliness as we received here. Highly recommended.

We stayed here for 3 nights on the 2nd part of our trip around New England and thought it was great! The Inn itself is really lovely and grand but not over the top. The decoration and furnishings are spot on and give the place a very nice comfortable and homely feeling.

We didn't specifically choose our room as it was booked through a travel agency but I believe we had 'Bronte' and it was perfectly comfortable. The bed and pillows were lovely and soft and we had perfect nights sleep when we were there. Traffic noise and distrubances were practically non-existant. The room had a small flat screen TV, a couple of chairs and chests of drawers. The bathroom was small but perfectly adequate. The Inn does have free Wifi but it was very weak and quite slow.

We had never really stayed in a B&B before and I loved all the little extra things like small library and DVD collection you could make use of, and the cookies laid out every evening. I really looked forward to coming back from a day out and resting up in my room with a complimentary hot chocolate and cookies from downstairs.

The breakfast in the morning was also great and changed each day, with 4 courses you can never leave with an empty stomach!

Mike and Helen and really great and friendly hosts and knows loads about the area. We were given great suggestions about the best beaches to go and visit. I'm sure anything you would want to do they would know about it and there is lots of info, maps, books, in the Inn to help you. I fell in love with Cape Cod while we were there and didn't get to do half the things I wanted to. A good excuse to come back!

I think for the first time ever when leaving a holiday accomodation I was sad to go and would have loved to have stayed longer. I look forward to coming back again.

Having just returned from a stay at The Inn at Cape Cod, I was very interested to read the other reviews - good and bad. I therefore hope this review provides a balanced viewpoint.

Like one of the other guests, we did arrive 20 minutes early and having called the number on the door, we were told we had to wait for 20 minutes until check in opened at 3. After a two and a half hour drive, this was slighty frustrating, so we had to wait on the doorstep.

However, having now met Helen and Mike and experienced their hospitality, they really do want their guests to have a superb time. Their local knowledge is unsurpassed and they were very willing to help in any way.

The inn is beautiful and spotless throughout. While a couple of reviews have moaned about the ''rules and reguations", they rather unfairly forget to mention that the building is listed and therefore additional care and attention is needed. They also happen to be very proud of their inn and I'd rather rather stay somewhere that is looked after. I'm always the one that spots the scuffed paper and mildew on the shower curtain, so I'm quite fussy.

If i'm honest, this is the sort of place which is cosy and intimate. If you like to just be left alone and come and go as you please with no interaction with people, then you'd be better off with a larger hotel as this won't be for you. Other than perhaps an earlier check in and a little leaniency for those who arrive slightly early, this is a great place to stay.

'Extraordinary Inn'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed September 22, 2011

We were absolutely fascinated by this beautiful Inn . The hospitality of the owners impressed us as much as the historical building. We enjoyed a very delightful breakfast , which you would never get in a hotel. Mike and Helen are perfect hosts, their tips about Cape Cod were extremely valuable . We recommend to stay here : YOU WILL FIND NOTHING BETTER ON THE CAPE !! And an additional plus is the restaurant next door which seems to be one of the best on Cape Cod , Walking time : Under two minutes . Mike and Helen : Thank you for a perfect stay !

'Luxury on Cape Cod'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed September 20, 2011

The "INN" is actually a B&B which in the USA means something very different and upmarket than in the UK. The Inn is a beautiful 18th century colonial house on Route 6a, the Old Kings Highway, and is very handy for visiting all the destinations on Cape Cod.

All the furniture and fittings are of first class quality and the little extras (upscale coffee & tea machines, complimentary cookies/brownies, excellent reference library as well as the magnificent home cooked breakfast set this establishment apart.

Mike and Helen really care about their guests and you are treated as old friends from the minute you arrive until you bid a sad farewell.

Here I am , back in Apartment 407 at the Beverly Hills Plaza, my home away from home. I cannot stress enough, the fact that this is a huge apartment with a full kitchen, dining room, gorgeous living room, huge bedroom, marble bath with jacuzzi bathtub, all gorgeously furnished and appointed, for less than the cost of most hotel ROOMS in the Beverly Hills area. Located on the corner of Wilshire Blvd and Comstock Avenue, the hotel is across the street from the gorgeous park in Holmby Hills where President Reagan used to come and sit every day. I still have fond memories of talking with him, while walking in this beautiful, shady park. Add that to the fact that I am less than 5 ninutes away from Rodeo Drive, 15 minutes to the beach in Santa Monica, and surrounded by rhe best restaurants in the world. Bottom line? NOTHING compares with the Beverly Hills Plaza for comfort, location, space, and especially price!! I will be back in June, and in a two bedroom, two bath apartment, so that my husband can have his own bathroom. Unfortunately, you can't have 2 baths without two bedrooms, so one bedroom goes unused, but for families, what could be be better than that.....I stay here when I am on a business trip, and I stay here for all my pleasure trips. I am here for 12 days this trip and will be here for 10 days next stay. I simply would not stay anywhere else! Love this property.....best staff in the world. Most important tip......go for the one or two bedroom luxury suites, and ask for the South side of the pool, off of Wilshire Blvd where is it quiet and serene.

We've just got back from staying at the Beverly hills plaza for 11 nights and prior to going I had some reservations about the fact the reviews saying it was two separate hotels joined and the staff attitudes and the such like, but I can honest say that we could not fault it the whole time we were away.

Starting at the beginning when we arrived the staff were very friendly, the doorman/valet helped us unload the bags from our car and explained he would bring them up to our room if we wanted once we had checked in, we agreed to this and as I'll explain later it was worth every penny of the 3-4 dollars we paid him. Upon checking in the staff asked us if we had a car and would we be checking in we explained we would valet if we had to but if not we would park across the street (no problem as it is right opposite the hotel and there is a crossing 50m down from the hotel entrance) They had no problem with this at all.

Now the hotel I believe was two separate buildings at one time, we were staying in the building that was not situated around the swimming pool but around the Jacuzzi. There is a lift to take you to the floor where you cross over from one building to the other but when you get through there is stairs which you may have to carry your luggage up (see why $3-4 is worthwhile now!!)

The rooms are very nice (we had one with a separate lounge) and plenty of space for 2 people, there was a TV in each room and a small fridge/kitchen which came in handy for storing food /drinks. Housekeeping was very friendly and helped us out and came to see if we wanted the beds turned down every night.

Pool area was lovely with plenty of loungers (very comfortable padded sort) and there was a bar/restaurant if you wanted food/drink (it was quite pricey but you are in Beverly Hills)

If you are staying at the hotel you will need a car but then if you are staying in LA for any period of time you will need a car!!!

The only downside is the carts that housekeeping use to move their supplies/towels/etc. can make a lot of noise fairly early as it is concrete floors but there is not a lot they can do about this and I only noticed it a couple of the days we were there.

Having stayed at the Beverly Hilton and the Hyatt at century city before here I can definitely recommend this hotel as it was every bit as good, slightly more personnel and a lot more reasonable than either of the others.

'Great hotel, great location'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed February 13, 2012

We stayed here for a week in early February to celebrate my husbands birthday and had a great time. We upgraded the room to a suite which was really nice and spacious with a small kitchenette. The bed was very comfy and big and the bathroom was modern and spotless.

The suites seem to be in a wing to the side which my friend (who lives in LA) descibed as being "just like Melrose Place" which summed it up quite well! There is a side entrance straight out to Wilshire Boulevard from this wing so you dont have to traipse back through the main hotel every time. There is a hot tub (awesome), a koi pond (pretty) and lots of greenery so I really liked this wing. It felt like having your own apartment.

The location was great. LA is not a walking city but you could walk to Century City or Rodeo if you wanted, it's maybe 20 minutes. We parked our car directly opposite the hotel most nights for free (one night it was busy so we parked just around the corner, again for free) and avoiding the $28 nightly valet fee at the hotel. Everything is easy driving from this hotel - Bev Hills, West Hollywood, Santa Monica, shopping etc.

The staff were friendly and polite. We paid for one days worth of wi fi (about $15 I think) and had no problems.

I would stay here again for sure - the rooms were super clean and big, the public areas of the hotel were well kept and cared for and the location was perfect. We didn't use the pool but it looked great. The hot tub we did use and it was excellent.

The pool area is lovely and water is heated too, there is a small bar and restaurant that looks cosy, but we preferred the room service so we could enjoy the apartment, the menu is the same. There is also a day spa on the premises but it seemed quite expensive and a hairdresser. The hotel is on Wiltshire Boulevard which is very long, but away from the main centre near Rodeo Drive, we travelled by taxi, it was totally fine and convenient for us.
There is bus stop out the front of the hotel as well if you don't like to travel by taxi, if you like walking there is a great shopping centre called Century City which takes about about 15 mins
by foot. We dined at a fantastic restaurant called Rock Sugar at Century City, you will also find two department stores a grocery store and lots of designer and fashion stores.
We will definitely stay here again if ever we get back to L.A!

Stayed for business for 6 days. Checkin took forever as they were seemingly figuring out where to put me. The hotel has 2 sides - the upscale and the converted apartment building. I was put in the old side, and while it could be considered a "suite hotel", the actual size of the room is pretty standard. They are just narrow and long. The bellman showed me to my room (since there is no elevator on the old side), but did NOT take my bag, which I thought was odd. After climbing many stairs (only option), I settled in to find the only "desk" was taken by a desktop computer which cost $15/day. There wasn't even a coffee table, so if I wanted to do work, it had to be in my lap. The bathroom was also very small, with very little counter space, and the bathroom amenities are outdated. The mouthwash was nasty. The room had 2 flatscreen TVs (non-HD), but the cable was "being worked on" for a few hours so it was out. The kitchen consisted of a small sink and basic kitchen items. Cheap countertops and cabinets.

After 3 nights of poor sleep from the sun shining in (no blackout shade and the shade did not cover the whole window) and the pounding from upstairs, I switched to a top floor room. Again no help with my luggage even though the stairs were the only option. Cable went out 2 more times. It seemed like they were covering up problems/mistakes, not fixing them.

Another HUGE disappointment was the internet. For $15 for 24 hours, you get slow service on ONE device. I had 2 computers for work, so I had to pay $30 per day. And if I wanted to have my phone connect, it would have been another $15. Really? And you have to call the front desk to get a code to log in. Seems very outdated and cheap. Didn't even work properly all the time.

Housekeeping was fine, the morning newspaper was nice, but no breakfast, and staff seemed burdened when I had a question/issue.

In short, there are 2 sides to the hotel: nice and cheap. The lobby is nice, but the property is not well maintained. No desk to do work in the rooms. Card reader to get in the more convenient way did not work. Fitness center was about 20 years out of date. Staff was not so good. Walls/roof are very thin. Valet costs $28 per day when you can park across the street for free. Internet is $15/day for one device (no disconnecting/connecting to new device). Not really walking distance to anything special.

Who doesn't want to say they're staying in Beverly Hills? But who can afford it, really? Well, try the Plaza. I just got back from my first visit, and I can't overemphasize how impressed I was. First of all, what it isn't. The Peninsula. Don't expect stars or ridiculously expensive furnishings or an air of pretension. Although, truth be told, there were independent film people there, and the lobby really is gorgeous. I has that old Beverly Hills look.
What the hotel is: a comfortable, clean, efficient, warm, full-service hotel for about $100/night less than the surrounding places. I know. I checked. The room decor is not outstanding, but the beds are comfortable, and every room is a suite, which I think means big room with sitting area. I got upgraded, and had a separate living room that was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. There is a lovely pool area, a spa, hair salon and full exercise room. The hotel is perfectly sited, especially if you need to be on the west side, right at Wilshire and Beverly Glen, and about a block down from the lovely little Holmby Park where all the locals hang out. (I've stayed at Trip Advisor's #4 hotel, the Brentwood Inn many times, and as much as I loved it, I'd give it to the Beverly HIlls PLaza all over the Brentwood. It's more convenient, more roomy, has more amenities, and more helpful staff)
And the best part of the Plaza? The staff. They went out of their way to help in everything big and small. They rented a Voltzwagen for me for $44/day, which was dropped off for me at the hotel and then picked up there when I was finished. I just gave my keys to the concierge. If you don't think that was worth every penny. It didn't matter what time of the day or night, somebody was available and happy to help(if you've been out all day and don't want to go out to eat, have them give you the info for First Szechuan Wok, which delivers. Really good basic Chinese). The hotel restaurant IS very small, and can easily get overcrowded at breakfast, but the food is basic and good, the bartenders happy to serve, and it's damn convenient.
My only caveats would be that because the hotel seems to be made up of more than one building, its halls wander about, and it's easy to get lost.Not only that, if you have trouble with stairs, let the staff know right away so you don't get a room in the back, because stairs are involved. But that's really my only caution. I've already told them I'll be back this summer. I can't wait--especially because I can sit out by the pool then.

We stayed Dec. 30-31, 2011 in two rooms, one containing my wife and myself, the other our daughter, her husband and their two year old son. We took two adjoining executive rooms (bedroom and front room with kitchen essentials). It was perfect.

First, we booked the rooms only days before and were trying to save by booking one exec room and one standard. When we got to the reception desk the hotel upgraded us (about $10/night) to two executive rooms so that we could be next to each other. That was extremely helpful and considerate of them.

The staff was always very nice and accommodating, from the reception to the valet staff. The location is great, on Wilshire Blvd between Westwood and Beverly HIlls. We even found parking on the street both days and were able to avoid the $28/night parking fee. That may have been because of the holiday season, though, and if you did have to use their parking, it is valet and convenient.

In the back, near our rooms, there is some rushing water and a pond with koi. Our 2 year old grandson loved it.

The building looks like it was two older motels put together, refurbished, and a new front added. It is owned by Donald Sterling, so my guess is that when the real estate heats up again he would sell or convert this considerable footprint to a high rise condo building, like the many others on that stretch of Wilshire. But while it is there it is a little gem, well run at very reasonable price in a great location for those who want to get to central and west L.A. We were all extremely happy with the experience.

Coming off the back-end of two very long flights, we decided to break up our journey in Beverly Hills (for a variety of reasons, including the ever-popular "let's walk up and down Rodeo Drive experience"). A friend recommended the Plaza. It was a great choice. It's a unique hotel, situated around a courtyard with swimming pool. We asked for a quiet room away from Wilshire Blvd (which is a tad busy), and they put us in what was effectively a second wing. We had to walk past a little waterfall, the jacuzzi, loads of gorgeous green plants, and up some winding stairs until we reached our huge, well appointed room. We were away from all street noise and slept in peace and quiet. As I said, our room was huge: bedroom, kitchen/dining/living room, lots of storage space, and some comfy sofas. It was not newly decorated, but everything was extremely clean and worked.

We walked to the centre of Beverly Hills (around 20 minutes or so) for dinner and a bit of sightseeing. There's nothing much around the hotel, so you'll either have a bit of a walk or you'll need to drive. Traffic can be terrible on Wilshire -- we drove up from LAX in rush hour, and thanks to construction it took quite a while. Just be patient and be prepared for arbitrary stupidity from other drivers, and you'll be fine.

The staff at the hotel were great, from initial greetings from the parking valet, to the check-in staff, to housekeeping. Everyone was friendly and went out of their way to help.

Finally, LA is expensive, but the Plaza is very reasonably priced, and you get a lot for your money. We'd definitely stay again.

We happened upon this Inn at the last minute and how lucky we were! Spotlessly clean, quiet, relaxing, reasonable. Well located on the Cape to be able to experience a variety of activities. We extended our vacation and stayed another day here! Inkeepers helpful with needed information. Breakfasts were delicious, healthful, cooked to order. No frozen sweet rolls! Wish we could go back soon!

Having never stayed in a bed and breakfast before we found this to be an awesome experience! The day we arrived, after travelling for 10 plus hours we ran into a minor problem with our car. Mac and Karen were very helpful. Great location in the central of the Cape, central to all attractions. We stayed six nights and we will definitely be back. It was an added bonus that we were always made to feel like we were never bothering them with our many questions. Thank you Mac an Karen for an awesome experience. Hope to see you in the near future!

The Village Inn is a wonderful place to stay on Cape Cod. It is walking distance from restaurants, shops and the beach. We had almost all of the rooms in the Inn filled with family because of a memorial service. Despite the sad occaision, we really enjoyed our stay. The owners made us feel very much at home. I look forward to coming back and staying for a week or more. The poached eggs served for breakfast were the best! The rooms are well decorated without being too hotelish. The beds were very comfortable. I would recommend this Inn to everyone without reservation.

We already visited The Village Inn in 2006 and when we planned another New England tri[p, Cape Cod and The Village Inn had to be in it. The Village Inn is charming, 200 years old and centrally located in one of the nicest areas of Cape Cod. Don't expect the impersonal rooms you find in so many hotels. Our room had atmosphere and that's why we liked it. It has, by the way, everything you could wish in a B & B-room. And on top of that Kerin served a delicious breakfast.
Another good thing about The Village Inn is that there two excellent restaurants on a walking distance.

We had been travelling for nearly a month when we arrived at the Inn. We were greeted very warmly by the innkeeper Karen and instantly made to feel at home. We had a room with a king sized bed an a private bath. The floors sagged a little and creaked some but that is the charm that comes with a house the is nearing 200 years old. Karen was a wealth of knowledge on the Cape Cod area and provided excellent referrals to really good local dining. We spent two wonderful nights and left rejuvenated and ready to continue our trip. I would recommended this Inn to anybody visiting Cape Cod.

'A mixed bag.'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed August 23, 2010

I agree with an earlier review that the Village Inn is like staying at your grandmother's house. The stairs are crooked and creaky, the furnishings are pleasant but worn, and there's a bit of a musty smell. There is a certain charm. The screen porch offers a lovely and relaxing place to read and chat with other guests.

The inn keepers provided a wealth of local knowledge and sent us to some great restaurants and beaches. They are generally friendly save for a strange incident when my husband entered the wrong bathroom and we were scolded excessively like children. That put an unpleasant vibe on the rest of our stay.

Breakfast was simple but tasty and generously supplied. The service was impeccable. The young waiter even anticipated our requests from the previous mornings.

The rooms were clean but the literally threadbare bedspreads and seriously uncomfortable beds were a deal breaker for me. If we return to the Cape, we'll be staying elsewhere.

When we first heard that breakfast was served at 8:30 am, we were worried and set our alarm clocks. Silly! Around 8:00, we were woken by the most delicious smells wafting into our bedroom from the kitchen below. We followed our noses every morning we were there, and we were never disappointed. The food was excellent, but the hospitality was outstanding!

The rooms were filled with cozy furnishings, and the beds were soft and comfy! Mary and Judy were wonderful hosts! They were quick with advice as to the best restaurants, activities, and shared local history and current events with us. They even suggested good places and times to take breathtaking photographs.

Other reviews have mentioned that they are centrally located, and I've got to agree. It was never too far to go to get somewhere or to get back "home". They really made us feel like we were family while we were there, and I've no doubt we'll be seeing them again.

We had a wonderful time. One Centre Street is a great place and provided us a warm, friendly and comfortable get-away. This well-maintained, tastefully decorated inn is located in picturesque Yarmouthport along 6-A. The innkeepers have resisted the urge to fill One Centre Street with antique bric-a-brak, letting the period charm of their home show through. We started each day with a delicious multiple course breakfast and refreshed mid-afternoon with tea and pastriesbe sure to ask for the ginger snaps. From the advice on local restaurants to help with whale-watching, Mary and Judy helped to make our week-end a truly pleasant experience. Although we have been going to the Cape for 30 years, One Centre Street has made 6-A is our new favorite locale. We came as guests and left feeling like family.

'A treasure to stay in on the Cape'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed September 8, 2009

What an incredible treasure we found in the One Centre Street Inn in Yarmouth Port and the hosts of the Inn. From the moment we arrived to the moment we departed, we felt as though we were in our own home and truly felt welcomed. Having travelled extensively and stayed in all manner of accomodation, we can truly say that this is one of the best inns/b&bs that we have ever stayed in. The inn is well situated in a lovely small town that affords a quiter/peaceful vacation and yet given the size of the cape is in an ideal location for daily jaunts to the various parts of the cape.

We cannot say enough about the warm, knowledgeable and generous hospitality of our primary host (Mary Singleton). From the moment we arrived, we felt welcomed and at home. Not only did Mary provide us with great travel tips during our stay, but also lined us up with some fabulous dining experiences.

We stayed a total of 4 evenings - 1 in Cogswell and 3 in Doane, and loved both rooms for their tasteful presentation and very comfortable beds. Surprisingly, each of our breakfasts were different during our stay, and were not only filling, but delicious each time.

Thank you so much for an inviting and pleasurable stay during our time on the Cape. We look forward to our return and to debating which room in your lovely inn we will book. What a fabulous property!!!

A few friends and I traveled to New England last fall and staying One Centre Street was one of the highlights. The Inn is located on a historic, picturesque street, Olde Kings Highway, which boasts some of the most magnificent Cape homes. As echoed by every review so far, Mary, the inn keeper, couldn't have been a more warm, welcoming host. She was always available for restaurant suggestions or a cup of tea or just to offer up some good New England conversation, including bemoaning the loss of the Patriot's Tom Brady to injury.

We stayed in the Phillips room in perhaps the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! Breakfast was wonderful and allows you some social time with other guests of the Inn. Despite two or three other couples staying there, that was the only time we ran into them so the Inn never feels crowded.

Our only complaint was the stay there was too short!

My wife and I stayed here last week for our honeymoon and we couldn't have picked a better place. It is amazing what one can do with some updating and a little old-fashioned hospitality. We arrived during a driving rain storm and the first thing Al did was offer the use of an umbrella. Then, with my wife freezing due to packing for the summer rather than the cold New England spring, Terri offered coats, gloves and scarves. Try that at your local chain hotel. They knew the perfect places to eat and to visit along the cape and where to go on the islands. All in all, they were the perfect innkeepers and made out visit one to remember. Thanks!

'Best value in New England'

We have stayed at the SeaCoast Inn 3 times in seven years. Each time has been as good as it gets. It has to be the best value in New England, if not the US.

Terri and Al make improvements every year on the property but they can't improve on the service they provide, it is the best. You can read any of the reviews and you will find the same theme throughout. They go out of there way to take care of their guests.

We had made plans for our current trip so we didn't need a ride to the ferry or help with maps or things to do. They still asked to help with everything and when we started to walk down the street to the local store Al came out to offer a ride to the ferry if that was where we were going. The first time we were here in 2005 the rental car power socket didn't work so I had no way to charge our cell phone. Not to worry, they plugged it into their car while we were at dinner. On our previous trip Terri made reservations for us on a tour of Nantucket and when the tour operator got to the pick up location she asked who were the people Terri sent to be sure we got first pick of the seats.

It is true they don't have a pool or spa or elevator but they do have the best run operation west of the Atlantic.

We stayed at the Seacoast Inn last week for one night and all I can say is all the reviews are true. Terri and her husband go beyond out of their way to accomodate you and make sure that your trip runs smoothly. We stayed at the Seacoast Inn - which is ideally located in the town of Hyannis 1 block from the main street and one block from the port - to gain easy access for the ferry to Nantucket. Terri was so nice she even let us leave our car in the lot as to not have to pay for the ferry lot for the whole weekend because they had 1 extra space. It was so nice. I've never had service like that before...Just genuine nice people trying to do anything they can to accomodate their guests - what a breath of fresh air.

They also have the CUTEST dog, and i'm not even a dog person.

As they make mention - they are not a resort - but beyond that if you're looking for a good value, great Hyannis location and amazing hospitality - this is the place for you...If you can get a room.

First and foremost this is a Motel with no pool, hotel luxuries or needless frills but if you want a warm welcome when you arrive, value for money and wonderful hospitality throughout your stay then this is it. It really does justify the feedback and Al and Terri do everything they can to ensure you have a great holiday from booking ferry tickets, suggesting good places to eat, to providing daily itineries to get to places on the Cape that you might otherwise miss. Even on the way back to the airport they gave us advice on where to stop making sure our last day was well spent! After the hustle and bustle of Boston and New York, we arrived exhausted and they were so helpful with where to visit and really made this the most enjoyable part of our holiday.

It may look like a motel, and have motel services ( no pool, no resort-like feel), but the owners make it feel like a cozy bed-and-breakfast in the best possible ways. No frilly decor, or intrusive breakfasts and awkward halllway visits, but definetly a friendly and knowledgeable couple run this and enjoy what they do. Breakfast in the sun room is good, but not fancy. Access to washers and dryers, beach chairs, towels, free books basket --and individually created rooms make you realize this isn't just some chain. They don't gouge you in the summer prices and even have a deal on boat tickets to the islands, if you ask. No tourist trap here. A big thumbs up from a frequent traveler used to business hotels and expense accounts. This one is a great one for families, tourists, etc. Room #18 was large and comfortable with a refrigerator, table, microwave and large storage closet.

We had spent several afternoon hours on the Cape but were sure hotel prices would be over our budget that we didn't even consider staying the night...until we ran into a local gent who told us about the Seacoast Inn. He even bought us a copy of that day's edition of the Boston Globe that featured the hotel's most recent Trip Advisor award. With those kinds if recommendation, we had to stay!

I called the hotel and got reservations for $85 including breakfast for a spacious king room. Al, the owner, took my reservation but never took my name or credit card number. He said to just tell him when we arrive that I was the lady from Ohio and he'us show us to a room. And that's exactly what happened!

All the kudos expressed by others are some of the same I could repeat. These people are authentic. The stories are real.

The property has unique touches that make this place shine. My favorite is the electrical outlets and light switches built in to the headboard that was hand-built by the owner himself. Why doesn't everybody think of this? Put an outlet right behind me so I can plug in my cell phone, laptop, medical equipment or anything else I might use. And then put the light switches right beside the outlet. Oh yeah...put a shallow ledge on top (4' above floor height) so I can rest my cell phone. How convenient!

Will we be back? You betcha! After whale watching off Provincetown on an Al and Terri recommendation, we decided late in the afternoon to go back the very next night. We were so glad we were ahead of the busy season so a room was available. This time, we got a room with a brand new mattress.

It just keeps getting better.....

Just geting to the front door to the building I got splinters on my hand, from holding onto the railing. When I entered the rm. I wanted to run, but I had paid for 2 days, and would of forfeited my money. The rug had burn marks from a droped iron. The furniture was old and the rm was dirty, I looked up and you can see the amount of dirt on the ceiling fan. The First thing I did was use my pets blankets to cover the bedspread. I used my dogs towels to cover the pillows. Dinner the waiter's shirt was filthy, the dinner was o.k. I would't let my dogs in that pool, it was green. Skipped breakfast nothing to brag about, I just wanted to go home. When I got home the first thing I did was take a shower and wash my hair. I used the steam cycle to wash my clothes, which I left my luggage open on my porch for a couple of days. My dogs went to the groomers for a thorough grooming the very next day.I will never ever go to a place relying on pictures on a web site.

'Charming and friendly'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 22, 2012

We stayed 2 nights with another couple, and felt like we were old friends with the staff. They did everything they could to make our stay comfortable, and Mac, the innkeeper, did an excellent job of planning our excursions to explore the area, as did Matthew, our waiter. Both were very entertaining in their own way, with a great sense of humor. We were pleasantly surprised by the more than adequate lighting in the room, since we are both readers. Breakfast and dinner entrees were included, with a wide menu selection.

'A perfect way to celebrate our wedding day'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed April 30, 2012

My new wife and I recently enjoyed a very simple, but perfect wedding day on beautiful Cape Cod. We got married by a Justice of the Peace at her lovely 1777 home and then came a wonderful treat given to us by my Aunt and Uncle who live on the Cape, which was dinner and an overnight at the Colonial House Inn. They had often commented to us that they would go there for special dinners and had never been disappointed.
We arrived at about 5:00pm and were greeted warmly by Mac the Innkeeper who showed us to our room which was beautiful, spacious and very comfortable. Our party of four then enjoyed an absolutely delicious dinner in the part of the dining area overlooking the garden area. The dinner was perfect and the service very good as we lingered over with our wine, dessert and coffee. After my Aunt and Uncle departed my wife and I got into our jeans and took a leisurely stroll for about an hour through the very interesting streets near the inn and enjoyed the Cape Cod homes all of which were quite unique from the one next and many of them obviously dating back into the 1800 and early 1900 time frame. It was a great way to mellow after the wonderful Cape Cod inspired seafood dinner.
The next morning we had a terrific breakfast in the dining room featuring fresh baked goods from the Inn's kitchen and we had the pleasure of some great conversation with Mac who explained to us some of the history of the Inn and the surrounding area.
Our stay at the Colonial House Inn was a perfect way to celebrate our wedding and the start of our new life together. Thank you to Mac and the staff at the Inn.

'Pet Friendly!!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed March 5, 2012

We were looking for a pet friendly place on the Cape to escape from Boston. The Colonial House Inn was one of a very few places on the Cape that allowed us to bring our dog. The service was extremely professional. They have an indoor pool and Jacuzzi something that is rare to find for a Cape style Inn. Dinner was also included in the room reservation, so we sat down in their dining room in front of the fireplace and ordered stuffed haddock, which was amazing!!

'We had a wonderful weekend'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed January 30, 2012

My wife and I got away for a long weekend with friends and had a great time. Mac arranged to have all of our rooms in the carriage house and set the pool area up for us to have a private party. The rooms were clean and comfortable BUT they are not corporate chain hotel rooms. They each have their own individual character and charm. The rooms have WiFi and TV but, except to check the weather, I didn't use them. We had dinner and breakfast there every day. The food was excellent and the service even better. Our server was attentive and friendly while allowing us to enjoy our meals at a leisurely pace. The seafood was fresh and well prepared. Breakfast was a sampler of fruit, quiche, muffins, nut breads, OJ and coffee and tea. Mac is a fount of information on things to do and places to see on the Cape. We spent a couple of days exploring following Mac's directions.

This is a warm and friendly place to stay, unlike the cookie cutter hotels that can be found all across the country. We would gladly stay here again.

'Decent deal, especially in off season'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed January 30, 2012

We spent a January weekend there with a group of friends. The room rates include an expanded continental breakfast (the french toast was delicious) and your choice of entree for dinner (appetizers and dessert are extra). The dinners were good to very good, depending on how seasoned you like your food. My husband thought one meal lacked seasoning but the next night his meal was very good. Rooms are cozy but certainly adequate (we stayed in the carriage house). Things were clean. This is an old Cape Cod inn so it is not the Hilton - if you want that you should look for something else.

I was here over 10 years ago with a camping group and I set up a similar weekend this past weekend 1-28-12 for a group that we camp with now and we can say that any negative reviews on this web site are either fabricated or or from someone who just needs everything handed to them on a silver platter. The rooms are comfortable and clean including the bathrooms, the dining room and everywhere else. The food was excellent and was prepared in a timely manner. The wait staff also excellent and waited on us hand and foot.

Mac was a most gracious host and even had the pool; up to 95 degrees for us by Friday when we arrived. My group wants to go back next year and we have already booked this same weekend.

Our family including our dog escaped our freezing home due to a multi-day power outage. The Colonial House gave all of us the warmest welcome and great hospitality the never stopped throughout our stay. Instead of raising the rates like some places did during this extended power outage, they were kind to us in our time of need and dropped the rates for us. Speaking of rates...their regular rates are great and they include a wonderful breakfast and the best dinners. The staff went our of their way to make our stay special and we had an enjoyable time with our fellow guests as well. Our young children felt so comfortable there and can't wait to visit again. This was a second visit for my husband and me and we also plan to return in the future to this family-and-pet-friendly inn.

We spent the first week of November at the Colonial House Inn and it was a 5 Star stay.
The room was spacious, comfortable & clean, and smelled great (a real problem at some places we've stayed!). The staff was beyond helpful! The concierge and the wait staff were friendly and engaging, and full of helpful information. Mac Perna is a gem in the travel world, giving us suggestions for local Capoe Cod sightseeing and all the insider secrets. We left with a full agenda of recommended stuff to see every day, and they were all SPOT on!
We would gladly return and stay here again if we ever have the chance.

On October 28-30,2011 we spent the weekend at the Colonial House Inn in Yarmouth Port on Cape Cod Mass.
It was a Paranormal Weekend and I being a Ghost Hunter was all for that, we arrived at the Inn Friday afternoon and was greeted by Mac the owner he was so gratious and gave us a tour of the Inn and a ground level room because of my friends handicap we were pleased with the room we had in the Carriage House amd more pleased when later we were getting some activity on the clock radio and my K2 Meter going off at the same time like morse code and at 3:00AM Friday night there was a loud bang on our door!!! There was a Ghost Walk around town earlier but Mac found out for us it would be too much for us so he gave us the printed information and Saturday morning we did it our selves.Friday night Dinner on the Veranda was wonderful and there is a full stocked bar in the lounge so there are many spirits there ha ha.
Saturday after a great breakfast Mac gave us some shopping tips and directions we had a great time at the Just Picked and the Christmas Tree Shops and when we arrived back we were just in time for the First half of the Paranormal Presentation put on by the Massachusetts Paranormal Society from the area it was very informative and some of the stories from their investigations were great! We broke for Dinner and again the food was delicious after we ate we went back to the Pool area and we got to do a Investigation on the Banquet area and we did get some activity on the K2 Meters and I have a voice on my Tape recorder saying "Want it to me" and " Are we scaring you" so this place is very active.
Sunday morning brought another delicious breakfast then we had to leave but before we did we had Mac sign our Ghost books we purchased at the Inn and told Mac we were doing some more sight seeing at the Ancient Burial Ground and the Museum so there is plenty to do in the area for Haunted Activies and we are already planning a trip back in the Spring so go to their Web Site to see what they are planning.

This is the first time I've stayed at a hotel in New England where I enjoyed spending time IN the room as much as I do being out and about. For Hyannis specifically, I've stayed at four different places and while this costs slightly more than the others, it's the ONLY place I would recommend and it offers MUCH more, including pool with harbor view, beautiful breakfast spread in a charming setting, wrap around balcony to watch the marina, plus great location (walkable to everything) and friendly service (my husband isn't easily impressed but he was floored that the housekeeper left wine glasses next to our unopened bottle on the desk). If possible, go after high season and get the best value around.

The Anchor In Motel may be called a motel but the rooms and service are of hotel quality. It was clean and the bathroom and furniture are updated. Even better, it is right on the water and has it's own pier. It's one block form the port to catch the ferry to Nantucket and given the lack of parking in the area in general, this is very handy. It's also walking distance to the main street which has cafes and restaurants. My only complaint is that the bathroom was quite small with no counter space which seems inconsistent given the size of our room and that there was a large walk-in closet next to it. We took the cheapest room (there are 4 of these rooms) which don't have balconies and are on the ground floor, but I think next time I'll pay more for the other rooms which have balconies because everyone else was sitting out on their balconies watching the boats sail by. If you take the cheap rooms, there are chairs on the grass outside your door you can sit on and look out but the views are not the same as the other rooms which are on a higher level.

Although we arrived early and our room wasn't yet ready, we were welcomed and invited to leave our cases in reception whilst we went to explore the local harbour. Our room at this hotel was large, clean and comfortable with fabulous views of the marina. There were comfortable armchairs, a desk and separate space with a fridge and dressing room. It was a pleasure to have so many table lamps in all parts of the room. Sandy (hope I got her name right) in reception was very helpful and went out of her way to advise us on making reservations for trips, local transport etc. Breakfast was of the continental-style with a good variety of cereals, fruit, toast and fruitjuices. Coffee was available 24 hours a day and the dining room was comfortable and sunny. We had't realised that Cape Cod is very quiet until end of May and so ferry trips and public transport had a limited timetable. In spite of this, Sandy helped us get to our destinations and back again.

'A Gem in Hyannis!'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 30, 2012

My friends and I decided to stay at the Anchor In as our gateway to explore Cape Cod. I had a gift certificate to use and I could choose to stay at any one of the New England Inns & Resorts and I narrowed in on the Anchor In out of several choices.

I am very happy with the decision we made and the Anchor In is a lovely place! On the outside of the building it says "Anchor In Motel", but don't let that fool you. It's more like a charming, smaller hotel and the rooms are clean and upgraded. When I checked in the agent was very friendly and gave me a small "tour" around the property showing me where brochures with area attractions are, menus for nearby restaurants are, as well as where the lounge/ breakfast area is located. The rooms are just right in size and our East Wing Deluxe View room had a gorgeous view and porch overlooking the harbor. The breakfast at the hotel was a pleasant surprise! They have delicious, giant muffins, bagels, several kinds of cereals, fresh fruit and juices. It's only open until 9:30am, so don't sleep in too late!

I went back to the front desk to ask about ferries to Martha's Vineyard and the one leaving within walking distance from the hotel in Hyannis is $71 per person roundtrip. However, if you drive about an hour west on Cape Cod to Woods Hole/ Falmouth, the Steamship Authority ferry is $16 roundtrip with $12 parking for the day, and from the parking lot it's about a 10 minute drive on the parking shuttle to get to the actual ferry terminal. I was hoping to be more central to a place to take the ferry in Martha's Vineyard without being so pricey, but the drive is not too far and at least we were able to make it to the island! I inquired about restaurants in the area that have good pasta/ seafood, and I believe it was Francis, who took the time to search through several restaurants in the area to see their availability, menu, etc. which was much appreciated.

There are a wide variety of restaurants to choose from on Main Street in Hyannis mixed with several cute shops. It's just about a 3 minute drive to Main Street and we never had issues with finding a spot to parallel park on the street.

Overall, if you're looking for a great place to stay on Cape Cod in Hyannis, definitely stay here! The location on the scenic harbor, close proximity to Main Street, quaint New England charm, and attentive and friendly staff make this place a true gem in Hyannis!

It was a pleasure to have so many table lamps in all parts of the room. Sandy (hope I got her name right) in reception was very helpful and went out of her way to advise us on making reservations for trips, local transport etc. Breakfast was of the continental-style with a good variety of cereals, fruit, toast and fruitjuices. Coffee was available 24 hours a day and the dining room was comfortable and sunny. We had't realised that Cape Cod is very quiet until end of May and so ferry trips and public transport had a limited timetable. In spite of this, Sandy helped us get to our destinations and back again.

'Great Place!'

We enjoyed this hotel very much. The location is great - you can leave your car and walk to the ferries to go to Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. (Don't have to pay for parking!) It's also close to Main Street where there are lots of shops and restaurants. The view of the harbor is beautiful. The room was clean and well decorated. The staff were all polite and helpful. There really isn't a bad thing I can say about this hotel.

'"Great Location, Excellent Hotel!"'

We can't say enough good things about this hotel! We kept extending our stay. It was such a perfect location from which to visit all of the Cape. The staff is welcoming, the service is excellent, the breakfasts were the nicest we've had anywhere that we have stayed, and beautifully laid out in comfortable setting overlooking Lewis Bay. The grounds are beautifully maintained and the rooms are light and airy and the beds are great! Perfect Cape Cod getaway! We would HIGHLY recommend it and can hardly wait to return.

'A Gem in Hyannis!'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 30, 2012

My friends and I decided to stay at the Anchor In as our gateway to explore Cape Cod. I had a gift certificate to use and I could choose to stay at any one of the New England Inns & Resorts and I narrowed in on the Anchor In out of several choices.

I am very happy with the decision we made and the Anchor In is a lovely place! On the outside of the building it says "Anchor In Motel", but don't let that fool you. It's more like a charming, smaller hotel and the rooms are clean and upgraded. When I checked in the agent was very friendly and gave me a small "tour" around the property showing me where brochures with area attractions are, menus for nearby restaurants are, as well as where the lounge/ breakfast area is located. The rooms are just right in size and our East Wing Deluxe View room had a gorgeous view and porch overlooking the harbor. The breakfast at the hotel was a pleasant surprise! They have delicious, giant muffins, bagels, several kinds of cereals, fresh fruit and juices. It's only open until 9:30am, so don't sleep in too late!

I went back to the front desk to ask about ferries to Martha's Vineyard and the one leaving within walking distance from the hotel in Hyannis is $71 per person roundtrip. However, if you drive about an hour west on Cape Cod to Woods Hole/ Falmouth, the Steamship Authority ferry is $16 roundtrip with $12 parking for the day, and from the parking lot it's about a 10 minute drive on the parking shuttle to get to the actual ferry terminal. I was hoping to be more central to a place to take the ferry in Martha's Vineyard without being so pricey, but the drive is not too far and at least we were able to make it to the island! I inquired about restaurants in the area that have good pasta/ seafood, and I believe it was Francis, who took the time to search through several restaurants in the area to see their availability, menu, etc. which was much appreciated.

There are a wide variety of restaurants to choose from on Main Street in Hyannis mixed with several cute shops. It's just about a 3 minute drive to Main Street and we never had issues with finding a spot to parallel park on the street.

Overall, if you're looking for a great place to stay on Cape Cod in Hyannis, definitely stay here! The location on the scenic harbor, close proximity to Main Street, quaint New England charm, and attentive and friendly staff make this place a true gem in Hyannis!

My wife and I spent a delightful two days at the Gateways in early May 2012. We stayed in the Desdemona room, very comfortable and spacious enough for two people. There was a gas fireplace which we did not need to use. The bath was modern and very clean. The highlight of the stay, however were the two breakfasts we enjoyed. One featured blueberry pancakes and the other, French croissants with an omelet. Both were made fresh just for us and were delicious. In addition there was homemade yogurt, granola, artisan cheeses and jams. The owners of the B&B were very friendly and accommodating. Lenox in May was greatno crowds and easy to get restaurant reservations. We enjoyed hiking in Kennedy Park and the Mass. Audubon.

Michele & Eiran and staff were exceptional hosts. I attended a 50th birthday celebration which was held at the Inn and decided to stay there. The party was exceptional, the buffet was creative and delicious and the staff was available to meet your every wish and desire. I loved my accommodation, which had a fireplace, a fridge and a very comfortable bed. The only challenge was the small bathroom. A healthy and delicious continental breakfast was served each morning by the very lovely and nurturing Michele. I informed Michele that I would be leaving the Inn at 6:45 a.m. on my day of departure and she of her own volition made me a delicious fruit platter with yogurt and left it in the fridge in my room. It was a kind gesture and wonderful last impression of The Gateways Inn.

Just as I'd read in other reviews before booking this hotel, the staff were extremely pleasant. The front desk staff are welcoming & offer useful information about area attractions and directions. In our room, the housekeeping staff laid out towels artfully in bow-ties on the beds. I was happy with the fridge & free wi-fi. Beds were perfectly comfortable. I did find the walls to be incredibly thin; anything said in the hallway was clearly heard inside the room with the door closed. I might suggest adding room-safes, though I never felt unsafe at any time in the hotel. The complimentary breakfast offered a decent selection & included scrambled eggs. We stayed 3 nights. I would recommend it to anyone.

I am a travel agent and book hotels all the time. This property has completely changed my view on Days Inns. I have always thought them to be a 2 star property.. Until we stayed here in Hyannis. My husband and I are Elks and we went to the Cape for our annual State Convention. It was held in another hotel. We opted to spend a little less money and book three rooms at the Days Inn. It was very reasonably priced. At check in, the two gentlemen couldnt have been more accommodating. They talked about their free breakfast, fruit, yogurt, coffee, danish and the like. They showed us where the pools are, indoor and outdoor. They described places to go in the area. And they even made sure that our three rooms were across the hall from each other. The hallways were clean, the bed was comfortable, we had a lovely balcony.. I am sold! It was one of the best weekends away. We are from the North Shore in Massachusetts. But we will most assuredly be back. Thank you Days Inn Hyannis.. we had a grand ole time! Diane and Adam.

'Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
1 of 5 stars Reviewed June 8, 2012 NEW

I was so disappointed by this hotel. We stayed Memorial Day weekend, and it was so loud, and the room was completely opposite what was posted on the website, that I called other hotels for a room, with no luck.

We had an adjoining room, which we did not request; that would have been fine, but I could CLEARLY hear what the family in the next room were saying. Doors kept slamming constantly, and kids were running down the hall stomping their feet continuously as well. We were located near the indoor pool, which did not help.

The room example on the website showed an updated modern room. Our room had 1980's paisley polyester bedspread, a huge dehumidifier (not a good sign), and an extremley akward layout of furniture. The bath sink and vanity was on our right as soon as we walked in...very akward if you don't want to wake your partner in the morning. The bath and toilet were in a separate room.

I would never stay here again, and I would not recommend it to anyone.

The hotel is always clean and neat, the front desk staff well let's just say they are very valuable people. Chris (the manager) is always pleasant, polite and always sincere, and will always go above what we expect, Kalehl ( i am sorry for spelling incorrectly) at the front desk is a marvel, no matter how busy he is, he always takes the time to greet each person with a smile, remembers names, and is never ever rude. No matter how much stress is going on in our lives, once we connect here with the staff at Days Inn, its like we've come home. Thank you so much for that! I hope the company knows and appreciates the type of staff they have here.

'Value for money at the right price'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 4, 2012

If, like me, you typically stay at Hilton or Marriott brand properties then it would be easy to be disappointed with this Days Inn....but, for the price paid (just over $110 in this case) this hotel offers good value on the Cape. Check-in was a breeze and the front desk staff extremely helpful. The room was basic, but clean and had a flat screen TV, fridge and coffee maker although the supplied coffee was only enough for one cup of regular or decaf which seemed a bit mean if you had two coffee drinkers in the room. Fortunately, free coffee was always available in the lobby. The mattresses on our double beds were firm and comfortable, but the sheets felt cheap and starchy. One annoyance as we were settling down to sleep - our neighbors took a shower or ran a bath and the noise was extremely loud in our room - fortunately only lasted about 10 minutes. The free wi-fi worked very well. We thought the breakfast was low budget and not particularly appetizing (pancakes, tasteless scambled eggs, cheap pastries and muffins, bagels etc.) but just about satisfactory for the price (free!). Both indoor and outdoor pools looked OK but we didn't use them. The location of the hotel is great for getting out and about, and the proximity to shops and restaurants is excellent. Bottom line - most hotels/motels on the cape are overpriced and for $110 this Days Inn offers good value. If price is less important to you, I would definitely pay $30/$40 more to stay at the Hampton Inn about a mile away.

1st floor can be accessed directly to your car; however, if someone else happen to come back to the hotel late their car headlights might beam directly in your room. 2nd floor has a balcony. Either facing the road or facing the Mall in the back. Our room was facing the road (odd numbers, I think), during the week it could get noisy with local traffic from 5 am on. Breakfast serves daily including the normal cold meals plus hot eggs and pancakes. It was a great deal. The indoor pool and outdoor pool and Jacuzzi were fairly small.

This hotel was chaotic. The whole point of a hotel is to get sleep. In fact, the only 2 things I care about when staying at a hotel are: cleanliness and quiet while I sleep. I paid $170 WITH my AAA discount to stay here and it was barely worth $100. There were kids running around everywhere at all hours without parents. They kept slamming the doors (even at 7 AM) and running up and down the hallways screaming, even kicking a soccer ball in the hallway. I went out to the hallway and politely asked the handful of boys to please keep it down. After it continued, I called down to the front desk at 8 PM (we were exhausted after driving all day and wanted to just get some sleep). Since we had the next night also booked we asked if we could get a refund and just take our chances finding another hotel on Memorial Day weekend (because that's how bad it was). The guy was rude and said there's no way I could get a refund, but he would come up and check it out. It continued so at 9:30 PM, my boyfriend and I went to the desk and he said we were the first who called on a list of people and showed us a LONG list of rooms who had called to complain. He also was much nicer when my boyfriend was with me. He said he went up there to check and there were about 15 adolescent boys running and it WAS ridiculous in his opinion, there were no parents anywhere to be found, and some people just recreate and shouldn't. Since that did not help my case, I asked to be reimbursed again for the next night and to just cancel it. He told me he could not do anything about it and that at 10 PM the curfew is enforced. The chaos continued through all hours of the day and night, I cannot tell you how frustrating it was. Upon leaving I spoke to the manager who just said "soccer teams came in theres nothing we can do. Did you try calling us again? Someone even called this morning (it was only 8 AM) and we went and stopped the boys." Oh really? If you have a laundry list of people who keep calling and its the same complaint, why dont you do something? NOt only the noise and the hassle, but also the kids were spilling hte free coffee and putting their fingers in the condiments, just acting out of control. I will NEVER EVER stay here or at any Days Inn again - ESPECiALLY for $170. I was tired the whole trip and it basically ruined my experience.

Would it be a really quality experience staying here instead of wonderfully cozy Cape Cod B&B? The answer for us was emphatically,.. YES! It was a typical Days Inn with Days Inn-y stuff, but the personnel at the front desk were very helpful, friendly and welcoming. The pool was clean..sparkling!...open alot and always had lifeguard staff to help on hand. There was 24 hr. coffee and tea in the lobby. It was amazingly close to all kinds of fun things like The Cape Cod Mall (you could simply walk there... a few steps, yet blocked from any noise) and also wonderful restuarants. The breakfast was your basic food bar, but the food was decent and the fruit abundant, with little muffins and pastries. We slept well in a large Queen bed and had fun with the TV and computer. It served our needs and really helped us have a carefree get-a-way without a giant price tag, which gave us more lee-way to go shopping!

'Nice Holiday Inn - I would stay here again.'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 11, 2012 NEW

We had a king-bed room for 4 nights. The bed was VERY comfortable; the mattress not too hard or soft & the comforter was very nice. The room was very clean, except for the carpet which looked rather dirty. Nice large flat-screen tv with many good channels. The bathroom looks to have been recently updated and was very clean with a really deep bathtub, marble walls & floors, and new vanity & sink - a good functional bathroom. We were on the second floor and it was nice to be able to open the window to get some fresh air. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was your typical hotel buffet breakfast. Only comment we have is "no toast?" Friendly's is right across the street and Olive Garden is right beside the hotel. There is a grocery store across the street (we walked over) where you get essentials or do as we did and buy some 6-packs of waters or drinks & keep them in the in-room frige; otherwise, pay $2 each in the machines at the hotel. In room safe - love those. The pool looked nice, but we didn't use it. The Madhatter lounge is a nice lively night-time spot with televisions, music and a cool glass wall that has bubbles floating up - the bartender there is great - he makes you feel welcome no matter who or what age you are. They have a business center where you can print boarding passes free, but everything else will cost you. Every staffmember of this hotel that I encountered was very genuinely friendly. I would stay here again.

'Great Location'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 16, 2012

person found this review helpful

This was our first trip to Cape Cod and Hyannis was an excellent location for visiting the Cape and Islands. Hotel was easily found and in a good location with a good selection of local eating places which the hotel gave us information on at the point of welcome. Staff were very friendly and pool facility good (although slightly restricted in times for use - not sure if this was due to being early in the season). I would have enjoyed a swim in the morning but none available.

All in all a good value hotel in a good location with very helpful friendly staff.

Great to hear that our location proved to be an excellent "jumping off" point to visit the Cape and Islands. Also, thank you for your nice comments about the staff - which we will be sure to share. Sorry that you were not able to take a morning swim - you're correct, our pool hours will be extended as we move into the peak season. Thank you very much for writing.

We stayed in the king suite and found it to be clean and tidy if a bit dated. It looks like it was last redone about ten years ago. The tile in the bathrooms was missing some grout, and the celing could use some love (popcorn panels ...ugh)The windows (both downstairs and the loft) all opened, which is a nice change from "canned air only" hotels. The balcony had a nice view of the hotel's courtyard. Price was a bit on the high end to be a great value, but was far far better than the 80.00 a night places in Hyannis. Furniture and TVs (yes one downstairs and one in the loft) were all recent, and the staff was friendly and helpful. All in all a good clean place to spend the night.

Thanks for writing! We were pleased that you enjoyed the bi-level king loft suite which does give our guests additional space and a balcony for lounging. We will make sure our maintenance department is made aware of your concerns regarding the grout in the bathroom. Happily, all of our guest rooms have windows that open for fresh air - which we're glad was a plus. Thanks again for your feedback.

Have stayed at this location a few times. It is clean , the bathrooms looked newly renovated. It is an older facilility but there are no new ones on the cape. Everything has been renamed and remodeled from another chain. Slight confusion at check in quickly corrected by the front desk. Room was good , bed comfy, and a new TV.
Convenient location . I would stay here again.

Similar to just about any other chain hotel out there. The room was clean and spacious, just about everything I needed in a one-night stay.

The bar is really cool, with a backdrop of swirling bubbles and neon lights. The bartender there made a mean rum and coke.

Breakfast was so-so. It had the usual spread you would expect, and was pretty crowded. The food was good, but it seemed as though they were slightly understaffed for the crowd they were handling.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel. It was a great stay for the price.

'Good accomodation on Cape Cod'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 14, 2012 NEW

Stayed for one night and was pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality of the accomodation. The hotel is located next to the Cape Cod mall, so it is not the best hotel is you want to be near a beach, or is you are looking for a boutique hotel or charming B&B accomodation. But it is a very clean and comfortable hotel. The room was excellent - large and clean. And a nice feature is that you can open the window! The morning staff, in particular, were very friendly, and there is a good but simple restaurant in the lobby.
A good choice for a Cape Cod visit.

'best place I have stayed'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 3, 2012

Since they have recently made many new improvements to this place I can not find a fault with it. They have a very useful interactive large touch screen in the lobby. It is useful in finding weather, resturants, and flight information and more. I stayed for two weeks on business and tried their menue many times. I complained about the drain the first day and they fixed it right away. I had this same experience at two others and it was not fixed, and I dont even know if they looked at it. Clean, quiet, and modern. Great!

'Okay, but needs more oversight of regular housekeeping'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed May 20, 2012

Just came back from a family event down at the Cape and this is the first more negative than postive review that I have written. First, this is a good place, but the management needs to highlight oversight of housekeeping and routine observation of minor areas, such as cleaning around rink area - had not been thorough and I asked an attendant in the area to go over it. I showed what needed the attention - door area, sink area, and then later saw the edge of the shower area needed more attention; and the attendant did what was asked, but to be more pro-active, this need not be the job of the guest. The indoor pool needed to be tested for ph level, looked a bit cloudy. When we came in the room, it had faint cigarette smells, opened the window and got wonderful sea air which helped, could be the previous guests were heavy smokers and that can carry into a non-smoking area sometimes. When I went to the lobby, the retraction desk had a wire basket on the ground nearby, but it was full. This was during check-in time so it could be that they were busy, but it was not that busy. Small areas like this get noticed by guests and need to be emptied before it is too full. I have been to the cape many times and thought we would try Courtyard out for its convenience and level of comfort. he bed mattress was great, the linens were very comfortable, the reviews were mostly favorable. However, for the price I thought it would be a bit better for overall quality. I would give the staff a passing C, but with hope that they spruce it up a bit before the season really gets busy. It was only half full hotel with a full staff - three attendants on the first floor for cleaning rooms and two registration staff at the front desk, but it looked like they were just going through the motions, not ready for the prime time starting with Memorial Day full throttle. Executive management can make this review turn to a full appreciation if they pay attention to the details mentioned here. Otherwise, it is a good place.

Also for the quietest room, please request rooms far away from the mall side or the road side, because the Sears automotive garages are next door and may be removing lug nuts, the parking is also on Side B as they call it for easier access than walking through the hallways, and in the early weekend morning, the early bird departures for the ferry goers may be noisier than your preferences,,or also the seagulls, yes, a flock of seagulls, who love the asphalt next to the mall for noisy bird parties of throwing quohags, we will let the bird lovers explain what seagulls are doing out there at dawn. Enough said on finding the best rooms as we found out at dawn after a late night ourselves. Not a deal breaker, because we happily fell back to slumbering with fresh, crisp, cool salt air restoring our beauty sleep.

'Never Verbally Spar With A Guest'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed February 15, 2012

people found this review helpful

First, the hotel gave no indication they are under major lobby renovations. There was a workman using spakle inches behind the young man checking me in at what looked to be a mini bar.

The noise during the transaction was relentless. He took 3 other guest check ins over mine because he could not verify the reservation. When I asked for the manager--he told me there is no manager on at this time. What? 3:45 PM? A major check in time? I later found out this was NOT the case

I specifically asked for a quiet corner of the hotel to get some sleep. They put me near the hall's second enterance, near the ice machine, next to a guest who came for a romantic weekend. And this is February--off season on the Cape. The hotel was NOT sold out. I call the desk about noise at 6 AM. The night dek man was nice. He told me to call back later when a manager would come on. The manager who I was spoke with later in the morning admitted she never read the log book noting my complaint. She was terse with me on the phone. It was point---counter point with Alyson, the manager at the time. She said the halls were walked and they heard no noise. WELL.............The windows rattled with the sound of the wind. The walls were paper thin, hearing the couple next door having religious moments......."Oh, God! Yes!!!!" Yes!!!!

I had to call Marriott myself, hand the phone over to the man at check in, for him to get my Marriott Elite membership information. He called the closed Elite POINTS desk in Utah.

Never again.

Avoid this Marriot like the Medeival Black Death Plague. And this is from who stays at Marriott over 70 days a year.

5)If you are not traveling by car this is the place to be !!!

-ve:
1)No in-house catering present, so no breakfast/lunch/dinner
2)Doesn't look ideal for families somewhat but shouldn't matter as you spend rest of day outside.

I would have given 5 rating if catering was present.It is worth the buck spent.

I am spending a week here in April, 2012 and found it to be perfect for what I need. It's cheap ($72.00/ night) and very quiet. There's telephone, TV and free Wi-Fi in each room Counter staff helped me to use the internet and they were always friendly.
The neighborhood is convenient, located at the base of Griffiths Park and underneath the famous Hollywood sign. There is a small strip mall next to the motel with bank, grocery store, a Ross, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Thai and Chinese restaurants. More restaurants on the Hollywood Blvd. only a few blocks away. I would gladly return.

Not so good: the outside of the motel is drab as is the front office (kind of feels like you're visiting a prisoner or going to a mental hospital with its desk behind sliding window), walls are thin, pressboard furniture worn around the edges, windows are old so noise travels easily, heat/air con unit lowd so not really usable when sleeping
Overall: the management/owners seem to be making consistent improvements and if the furniture is updated, windows are changed, aircon/heat updated and front office redone this will be an incredible deal. They could even raise the price somewhat if they do that!

The courtyard echos sounds, so it is a bit noisy if you are a light sleeper. We were able to walk around the neighborhood in the early evening without feeling threatened, but we did see beggers and drunks and there were sirens during the night. The hotel has bars on the first floor windows.

Our room had a clean shower, but no tub. There is a hot tub and pool in the courtyard, open 9am-9pm.

'Has the potential to be better'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 13, 2012 NEW

The staff was extremely friendly throughout the hotel, especially the front desk, who was very helpful with providing suggestions for restaurants and beaches near by. The lobby was nice and big, and the breakfast provided was OK, but it was free so I'm not complaining to much. The rooms were a good size. Ours had a mini fridge/micro which was a nice amenity. I liked how the vanity was outside of the bathroom. It made it easier to get ready in the morning. New flat screen TVs that swiveled were very nice.

The internet throughout the hotel was extremely poor. We had to go to the lobby for the internet to be tolerable. No option for Ethernet connections that I saw which made the situation worse. Hotels now a days should have adequate speeds for their internet. At least 1MB per second. We were lucky to get half of that in the lobby.

The pull out couch in the room was torn on the arm and extremely worn. Also not very comfortable. I feel sorry for who ever has to sleep on it. Some of the outlets in the room had no face plate, which is not safe at all. The caulking around the toilet was almost entirely gone. And the wall paper in the bathroom was stained and starting to peel. No HBO while we were there. According to the front desk, they were still in the process of upgrading the cable service after installing the TVs.

If only one of the above issues could be addressed I would suggest the internet. Having crappy internet speeds now a days is like having a TV without cable. Please fix!

Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel on Tripadvisor. On behalf of our staff, we apologize for not providing you with a better experience while staying with us. I can understand your frustration with not being able to utilize our indoor heated pool and whirlpool as we were required to do some repairs and maintenance on some of our pool equipment. Unfortunately since the need for these repairs were unanticipated, we were not able to inform you of the pool closing in advance. However, thanks to these repairs, the pool and whirlpool are now in terrific condition as we enter the summer months. The construction trailer was used to store our old televisions as we recently purchased 37 inch Panasonic flat-screen televisions for all of our guestrooms. The trailer has since been removed. I'm glad to hear that found our hotel staff hard-working and friendly. We take a lot of pride in providing our guests with exceptional service and we are pleased to hear that you found this to be the case. I hope you will give us another opportunity to stay here again in the near future.

Front desk clerks were not very personable. There are no elevators. Breakfast area was gross. I walked down to breakfast the first morning w my daughter looked around and left. Waffle iron was filthy, counter tops were gross. There was an attendant but she had to be paged. One side of the hotel was being renovated. I just couldn't belive how unpleasant it was. The room was maybe a 6. The sink was outside of the bathroom. The walls were dirty. We thought about leaving but w 2 small kids its not that easy. I wouldn't even let my kids go in the pool. We stay at The Comfort Inn in North Conway NH alot and the difference is night and day. Dont waste your $$ here you'll be dissapointed.

We booked this hotel following reviews on this site and our guide book. The hotel was in a great location and the staff were all very helpful and polite. There was a free continental breakfast served by the pool and also plenty of free parking

The problem came with the room we were given, 318. It felt like we had been given the worst room in the hotel. The carpet was dirty and didn't appear to have been cleaned (in fact the whole room felt dirty), there were screws on the bed from the door handle, which was razor sharp. The room was above the pool filter which vibrated through the room from about 7.30 am, in the evening we had to ask (a few times) for it to be turned off due to the noise. The room was also at the top of a staircase by a door banged everytime someone walked through

For some reason we were unable to switch rooms on the first night and on the 2nd we were out long enough and returned at 10.30 and just asked for the filter to be turned off, and it was

The inn cost $200 for 2 nights and although may be classed as budget, the room was well below par

My husband & I haven't spent time down the cape in years. Like 35 years. We decided to go down for a few days & I spent hours checking out different motels down the cape & you have hundreds to choose from. We decided on the Hyannis Travel Inn because they were having a great package - buy 2 nights get 2 nights free. You can't beat that deal. I was so surprised when we pulled in to find out it was the same place we stayed at 35 years ago - at that time they were running a special where they gave you a gift card for a local restaurant. The place has only a few small negatives & many positives. The negatives were they use a key instead of a key card - we felt safe IN the room with the double locks but I'm always leary about leaving the room wondering how many people could have duplicated the room key. The toilet paper roll was on the opposite wall of the toilet & couldn't be reached from sitting ON the toilet. I know it's little but aggravating. We were also told we'd get a king size bed & we got 2 double beds, not a biggie but not what we were expecting. The positives are many. The room was clean as was the bathroom. They had a bath mat you could use in the tub which was a huge positive for me as I have a bad knee & it made me feel safer. The first day we came back to our room & found the maid had been there. We didn't get maid service the 2nd day though I don't know why. The room comes with with a refrigerator & WiFi. Also a blow dryer & something they called an I-ron. Think it might be something to do with an I-pad or I-phone. Also came with an I-Ron board that you must use the I-ron on. Couldn't figure it out. (just kidding). The continental breakfast was awesome. Didn't matter what time we arrived, there was plenty of food. Okay so they don't cook eggs for you - wait a minute - they actually do! There are had boiled eggs, as well as pancakes & waffles (though I didn't see any syrup), different kinds of muffins & pastries, bagels, toast, cereal, coffee, tea & orange juice. Because we couldn't use the 4th night, they told us we could come back & use it in October- so we already booked it. They have an indoor pool & hot tub which we never got to use but it looked very nice. Oh, the place was QUIET. Very important for us. Even though they were totally booked the weekend we stayed, it was quiet. The motel is within walking distance of downtown Hyannis & I'd suggest walking if you can. We tried to find parking on a rainy Friday night & maybe because it was raining it was so busy but we had a hard time finding a place to park on Main Street. We didn't see any town parking lots or anything like that.

If you are looking for location and value then this is your place.

We have stayed at the Hyannis Travel Inn a few times and it always delivers. We use it as a launching point for our kid's sporting events on the Cape but we have seen groups of golfers, seniors, and girls on a shopping weekend staying here as well. We keep our expectations in check so we are always pleased. It is not the Ritz. It is a well managed family operated motel in the Cape Cod tradition. While certainly not a new hotel, we find that they are always updating some element of the motel on a continuous basis.

The prices are great and the location, one block off Main Street is a winner. Shopping and dining are only steps away. There is an Italian restaurant, an Irish Pub, and a Steakhouse / Sports Bar all within a 3 minute walk. Waterfront dining is only about 10 minutes on foot and all the shopping of Main Street is basically across the road.

The indoor pool is a nice plus for our kids and the continental breakfast served poolside saves us a breakfast expense at the start of each day.

We got a great offseason special on their website and I think they may also offer AAA discounts.

This was my second time here and it offers the best value on a budget with the locations in downtown Hyannis. There's an indoor pool, jacuzzi and outdoor pool for the summer. They offer continental breakfast (waffles and pancakes that can be either microwaved or in the toaster), danishes (cinnamon roll, cheese danish, apple danish, etc.), hard boiled eggs, yogurt, cereal (Cheerios, Raisin Bran, Bran, etc.), English muffins, wheat/white toast, plain and poppy seed bagels with cream cheese, coffee, and orange juice.

The room accommodations were good. The water pressure in the shower was great. Most budget hotels I've been in do not have good water pressure so this was a plus for me as well as free wifi and close to plenty of restaurants - seafood, pizza, fast food like McDonald's and Burger King, Mexican, etc. Also close to local beaches and shopping.

My recent stay encouraged me to write this review because of the responsiveness of Liam. After checking out, I realized my ring was missing which I must have dropped along the way from the room and car. The staff was very, very helpful and helping me find it. The lady that tended the continental breakfast area, walked with me from the room to the parking lot to the stairwells and the lobby looking for my ring. The maid also helped me look for in the room while she cleaned it. After no luck, I notified Liam and he said he would call me as soon as it was found or turned in. Well, 20 min. later while on my way to Race Point, he calls and tells me that his son found the ring in the lobby! He then said he would put it in an envelope and leave it at the front desk. I went back after my afternoon at the beach intending to leave a monetary gift for his son but the staff refused. They would not take it.

Based on my experience I would recommend this hotel. The staff is very helpful and in my case, extremely helpful. It may not be a resort but for a family on a budget, this hits the spot.

I spend part of my Spring break vacation here with my daughter every year and never disappointed.

My daughters and I stayed here for three nights during February school vacation. I found the Inn via their excellent and accurate website. Liam and Jennifer were completely accommodating to us from the moment we arrived and throughout our stay. They put us in a nice-sized two queen-bed room. Both the room and the bath had recently been updated nicely with a flat screen tv, refrigerator, microwave, brand new matresses and bedding. The location of the Inn is fantastic being one block away from Main St. Having the included breakfast poolside was a bonus. I could finish my breakfast and sip on my tea as the girls enjoyed the pool. I loved the spacious spa. We unfortunately had a very noisy large group staying at the Inn at the same time. Our sleep was compromised due to them. Liam responded to our needs when we asked for his help. Being sure that a large group will not be staying there at the same time, we will happily stay here again!

'Great weekend in February, will do again!'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed February 22, 2012

My wife and I just spent a weekend here and had a wonderful experience. As noted, the buildings are due for some sprucing up, but the people were super nice and the room was great. Jennifer and Liam at the front desk really know what being customer friendly means!

We had 2 queen beds with a good sized table between them, and along the same wall was a comfortable love seat, so the room was quite large. Add an older but functional fridge, a microwave, and a TV (also an older model but it worked fine) and it was a very spacious and comfortable room.

It's perfectly located a few steps from Main St. and many many local eating and drinking spots. Right now a lot of places are yet to open, but there are a fair number of restaurants open, and just being to leave the Inn and go for a walk along Main St. was great.

We took advantage of the Valentine's special, which was nicely done. We couldn't stay a third night, so we got a "Night to go" certificate which we'll be using to have another nice relaxing weekend on the cape before crazy season!

What a pleasant hotel. Good facilities, good staff and very clean. Revamped bathrooms good, huge beds, large rooms and gets special security by virtue of the carpark having the entrance to Barnstaple PD. Both the restaurants good, and with its own gift shop. Good for kids with a beach area, beach volleyball. Inside and outside pools and tennis courts. Free wifi a great benefit.

'Dated rooms'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2012 NEW

We stayed a couple of nights at the Cape Codder recently. The room we had was a really good size and the bed was very large and comfortable. The thing that let the room down was the decor as it just looked really dated and the bathroom looked as though it hadn't been decorated for a good while!

We didn't use the pool so can't comment on that but ate in the Hearth and Kettle and found it to be reasonably good value with good service.

We stayed here for one night and although it rained the whole time, my kids had a great time in the indoor wave pool. It wasn't very crowded and we could get everywhere we needed to within the resort without going outside. We got a $10 voucher to the restaurant with our AAA restaurant and enjoyed our meal. We'd love to come back in better weather to try the outdoor saltwater pool and make smores outside. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

'good family place'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 9, 2012 NEW

We spent a long (5 nights) Memorial Day Weekend at this Resort. We had a two double bed room, which was clean, and pretty big. The bathroom was updated recently. The maids were thorough with cleaning the room daily.
We enjoyed the outdoor pool and hottub, and our 4 year old daughter the inside one, the "pirate ship", which was lots of fun!
The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because we requested a minifridge at the time of booking, and I was assured we'll have one; we double checked this at the time of our arrival, and yet, when we entered the room, there was no fridge. A couple of days later we asked about it, and we were told someone will bring it; but no one came... so we insisted, and finally got one for the last night... at least, they didn't charge us extra for it... And another reason: the beds were not too comfortable... and were very squeaky...
All in all, I would say it was a nice place to stay.

'Very nice- especially for children'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 4, 2012

we stayed at this property for 3 nights over the Memorial Day weekend. It was a very nice, clean, well managed place. There were soccer teams staying at the same time, so our two boys loved it... seeing so many other children and playing with them in the pool and by the fire pit in the evening roasting marshmallows!!
The place it truly catered to young children and our boys loved it.

The Hearth and Kettle restaurant was not good at all- we ate dinner one evening.
The hotel snack bar by the pool was also just ok!

There is a nice Olive Garden next door where the food was much better (we ate dinner there one night)

The Cooke's seafood place near the hotel was overrated.... skip it.

We didn't stay here, but we bought day passes for the water park and had a blast. The cost wasn't bad at all. Twenty-five dollars per person. It was fun for a rainy day on the cape. The only thing I wasn't happy with was I couldn't purchase passes in advance. They let their guests have first choice. Other than that it was fun. Loved the extra large jacuzzi.

I stayed here with my 11 yr old daughter over April vacation. I was impressed with our room, very clean, spacious and the bathroom was brand new. There was many activities going on for the kids throughout the day but my daughter wanted to spend most of the time in the wave pool. It was very crowded and it had to close down a few times unscheduled due to feces and vomit. This is to be expected during a school vacation week. It's definatley a "kid's hotel" so don't come here expecting peace and quiet. I was woken up at 6am to kids running up and down the hall screaming and it didn't stop. We ate 2 meals at the hearth 'n' kettle (on site) and it was very good. We would love to go back but I think I will try to avoid a school vacation week next time.

was very pleased with the hotel during this past april vacation they have a lot for the kids to do lots of movies awesome pool area with wave pool and to small slides also a great hot tub the adults can sit in relax and watch the kids in the pool area at the same time

they also have a fire pit to roast marshmallow although i thought it to be way to small for as many people that were there it should be much larger area you really need to watch small kids if you do this.

game rooms 3 different one in different areas which was nice for the kids they also had face painting and a stuff your own animal event which was an additional cost but was fun..

they really cater to the kids rooms were clean as well as the common areas will be back hopefully sooner than later

only negative was the restaurants on site the servers were not the best maybe understaffed but they dropped the food to the table and never came back had to get my own water napkins ketchup

The Cape Codder was nicer than I expected... The room was spacious, the furnishings were updated, and all the staffpeople we encountered were very friendly and helpful (especially at the front desk). We were visiting with two children during school vacation week, and the hotel had lots of special events (dance parties, face painting, etc.) to keep the kids busy. It was also nice to have a restaurant right in the building. Of course the main attraction was the wave pool, which my kids went crazy over. It was a lot of fun, although the lack of seating proved to be a problem. It's tough to visit a pool and have nowhere to sit or stow your things... A few more chairs would have been appeciated. Overall, though, we had a great time and I would recommend it, especially for families.

My now husband and I stayed here for a few nights in August. The location was convenient to restaurants, but not to the beaches we wanted to go to. The rooms has this weird smell...almost a moldy smell. The hotel was outdated and not as clean as I would like. Parking was iffy most of the time...hard to find a space. Good price to basically drop your stuff, go out all day and night and then come back to sleep. I remember the AC worked great.

Stayed here twice. Once on a weekend and the second time midweek. Rooms are very noisy if you have anybody staying in an adjoining room. Neighbor turned on the TV around 2 am and was speaking in normal voice, but we heard it all. Called the front desk, and heard the neighbors complain when the front desk called them to ask them to keep the noise level low. Continental breakfast varied, full kitchen only on weekends offseason. Staff was plaesant, pool and sauna were okay. Facility definitely needs an upgrade. Location is right on Main Street, close to the ferry. Holiday Inn might be more $$$, but the facilities there definitely outshine the Heritage House.

This a motel. Don't be fooled, it's a motel. The rooms were only slightly larger than a typical holiday inn, and they are in desperate need of renovation. The bed was ~ 2ft off the floor ! The bathroom was dirty and the fixtures were worn. I was disgusted by the lack of cleaning by housekeeping.
Service in this place is awful. The bell hop doubles as the bus boy and waiter at the one and only restaurant. The food was tasty, but the staff was so rude, I walked out one day. We were traveling with a tour group. Breakfast buffet was provided every morning, but there was apparently a policy that 4oz of juice was the limit for each patron, because when I asked for more juice, I was told that I had had all the juice that I was permitted to have for breakfast....that's when I walked out!
Please stay elsewhere. I certainly will the next time I visit Hyannis.

'Uninspiring but clean.'

Not what we expected at all after seeing the website. Built at the end of the 60s and is still there! Reception not very friendly or helpful except at one point on the 2nd day when they printed a driving route to New York for us. Asked about breakfast - "yes, we serve breakfast". No more info - had to drag bits out of them. Asked about evening meals - no the restaurant only opens Fri and Sat eve. But each evening they were providing meals for coach parties. We probably wouldn't have eaten there as there is loads within walking distance down Main St (though avoid Schooners - see review) and lots more a short drive away. Because of the attitude etc we decided to have breakfast out and found a good place almost next door (Persy's Place) and one across the road. Rooms - spacious, dated, bed the least comfortable of any we've had during this holiday. Bathroom cramped and needs modernising. Reception smells of chlorine from the pool (pool looked quite nice). Wi-fi, as a previous person has said, only available in reception. Reception consists of a few chairs. Website says also available in dining areas but told we couldn't go in there!
Not a hotel we'd go back to or would recommend - I'd class it as a motel.

'Beware the front desk'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed October 20, 2011

Called for reservations this summer and spoke to a young man whose command of English was iffy and reserved what seemed to be a suite for the family at what seemed to be a decent price. On the way to the hotel that evening, I realized we were running quite late and so telephoned the hotel to confirm that we wouldn't be arriving for another few hours; the young woman who answered told us not to worry.
When we arrived at 11:30 or so to check in I was told that we, or at least part of our party had already done so, which was impossible since we were all together. The rooms had been given to someone else (whose name, by the way, bore no resemblance to ours). And it turned out that the suite we had reserved did not exist either, and the price we had been quoted referred to one room, not the total. Close to an hour followed while one man behind the counter retreated to an office where we could hear him make calls to other management, while a another man (foreign, much younger) who obviously had less authority stood by uncomfortably and waited for orders.
Finally, way past midnight, we were able to get the first man to emerge from the office and were given two rooms in two separate buildings for the price we had originally been quoted, although he was quite obviously angry with us for insisting on paying that price. I never saw the rooms in the main building and so cannot comment on them, but the rooms in the motel-like buildings in the parking lot were fairly large, plain, motel-like and decently clean. The price for the rooms is clearly based on the location of the hotel and the fact that it was high season on the Cape - they were not high-end rooms.
Encounters with staff - not the same as the night before - the next day were pleasant enough. The management apparently hires young Europeans for the summer, some of whom do not have the requisite language skills or sufficient knowledge of the area to be of help (we overheard one young clerk tell a guest a driving time to Provincetown that was way off, especially for a Saturday). In the worst cases, like ours, the miscommunication makes for exhausted guests and angry staff.
Great location if you need access to the ferries, however!

Don't usually like to complain but first impressions count and ours is terrible. Hotel advertises hi speed wi-fi. Hmm but thus does not include wifi access in the rooms. Asked the receptionist if we could be moved to a room with wifi access. Not possible as the rooms don't have wifi access apparently. How can a hotel advertise that it has wifi? Staff are rude. The savings made by staying here are really not worth it. Do yourself a favour and in such a beautiful area book into a decent, customer focussed hotel or B&B! This hotel will disappoint you.

It is literally right across the street from the boats. The hotel and rooms are severely dated. I was not too fond of the glass sliding door. The beds and pillows were very uncomfortable. The bathroom was small and some of the fixtures needed attention. The breakfast in the morning was pretty disappointing but what do you expect for continental? Again, you can't beat the location. I doubt I would stay at this hotel again. I do plan on coming back to Hyannis in the near future. Hopefully the owners will put some money into this place to bring it up to industry standards.

My husband and I spent a few days here and very much enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in a perfect location overlooking the harbour in Hyannis within easy walking distance of restaurants, bars and attractions. It is not a luxury property but the rooms are clean and quite big. The decor is somewhat tired but the price is reasonable. Coffee juice and pastries were included in lieu of breakfast. It would be a big improvement if something savoury were to be included e.g. bread rolls or bagels. We could not see the point of sweet food for breakfast. All in all a nice place to "chill out" at a reasonable price.

A very basic hotel with throwbacks to the 70's.  Location is wonderful as it is directly across from the Hyannis Harbor.  If you are looking for super modern with loads of extra's then this is bit the place for you.  It is a simple, clean, and fair priced motel.

Pro's
-directly across from the harbor
-very clean rooms
-majority of the staff is wonderful and very helpful
-ample parking
-indoor and outdoor pools
-free coffee and small pastries
-family run for many years
-loads of coupons and brochures in the office.
-great evening staff recommended the Black Cat next door..thank you!

Con's
-was a wonderful weather day on that Friday and Saturday and the lady (who is pregnant) refused to open the pool outside.  There were kids that thought 80 and mostly sunny in the afternoon was too cool.  Same weather on that Thursday and Monday and pool was open (different lifeguard)

-one very rude and condescending front desk employee (daytime, woman, glasses)  I wish I had her name because I would have spoken to the owner)  She was observed to be very mean to a fellow worker in the parking lot.  He was a maintenance worker who was very friendly with everyone. She was screaming and berating him in the lot about a trash bag and towels.  We had just been walking through the lot and heard her very loudly.  We even hard issues with her at the front desk when we asked a few questions about the pool and about an Internet coupon.  We are not sure if we would go back again next summer vacation as it really just bothered us a great deal.  Our kids were amazed at her and would see her and they would go the other way.

Otherwise, we would stay there again if you can avoid the one bad apple.  Sad because we had a wonderful vacation when not considering her.  I hope that it will be taken care of in the future.

'old motel'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed August 22, 2011

My family and I stayed here aug.18 -20. Pros: availability, close to ferry to martha's vineyard, free parking and walk to veteran memorial park and kalmus beach. Also, the front desk was very nice and allowed us to leave our cars in their lot for free the day we checked out so that we could take the ferry to the vineyard (came back same day).
cons: motel is old, not updated, and charge $5 extra for refrigerator. Normally I wouldn't care but we had our infant daughter with us and had to keep her food and milk refrigerated. Thus this motel is not best choice if you have kids. No irons and hair dryers in the room, you have to go ask for one at front desk. the grounds are not pretty. Pools are really small and the outdoor pool is just in the middle of the parking lot!
cleanliness: my room was dirty there were roasted nuts on the chair and nuts on the rug. They did not change out sheets daily, which would of been ok but I don't even think there were fresh sheets to begin with. The beds were old. Overall this is a bare bones motel. nothing special, just a place to sleep. I would not suggest it for families with children, maybe just adults. Bathrooms are small (mine smelled) and shower head was broken.

'You pay for location!'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed August 21, 2011

You pay for location and this place has it! Right across the street from the Hyannis Harbor, where you will catch the boat for Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. Also great place to catch a fishing boat for hire and there are plenty of them. Half and full day. There are a few rooms facing the harbor, we weren't in one of them, but just step outside our door and we could see the boats from our room.
If you are looking for anything modern, don't stay here. This places wreaks of the '60's. The toilet in our room was so low I almost needed a riser to get up from it. No bathroom fan, either. Basic linen and towels. Beds were average. Not the best or worst. Air conditioning units are in the wall at bed height and loud, blowing over us at night. I have trouble sleeping when it's not dark in the room. The curtains were thin and the light shone through the main windows, the back side windows only had a valance with no blinds. Same in the bathroom, though the windows were frosted. The room was very bright for sleeping. This may not bother some. Some mini blinds or full curtains would really help with the light shining in at night. We booked through HotWire for a what I thought was a discount. We could have gotten the same rate through the hotel. Also, my granddaughter was paging through a coupon book and they offered a discount coupon for "walk-ins" at about a $20 saving over our rate. This didn't make me happy. We were there during the busiest month, August, and they had rooms available for walk-ins. The outdoor pool was closed the entire time we were there (4days), but the indoor pool was open until 9PM each nite. Breakfast was minimal, but what I would call normal...coffee,tea, orange juice and pastry. Really no privacy if you wanted to sit outside of your room, you basically are sitting on the sidewalk, with your neighbor very close. We were on the ground floor. This is a VERY BUSY AREA. Right across the street on the same side as the hotel, you will find the parking for the boats. Cars coming and going all the time. But it really wasn't "noisy" when we were there, just very busy. We walked everywhere, mainly the main street, a few blocks away, to shops and restaurants. The beach area (really the bay, not the ocean) is not far, you could walk (I think it's far), but it's an easy drive with kids and the stuff you have to lug for a day at the "beach". The motel offers a discount coupon for a few restaurants, $6 off 2 adult meals. Not bad. The staff was very helpful and nice. The motel was very clean and kept-up as far as that goes, but for the price of the room, I expected much more. I would stay here again if I went during the off season when the rooms are $65, but I wouldn't spend $138/night again to stay here. But, like I said....location location location.

We enjoyed our stay at the Hyannis Inn Motel even throughout the blustry days of hurricane Katrina. Power was out in the town but our friendly staff was waiting with flashlight. We enjoyed the large deep pool and the fact that the windows in our room opened so we could enjoy the ocean breeze during our stay. On our next visit we plan to ride our motorcycles and join with the manger who is a local biker.

'NEVER AGAIN'
1 of 5 stars Reviewed August 20, 2011

Let me start by start by saying that we booked our stay at this Motel because it is located right in the center of town and the staff was very friendly upon booking reservation of August 1 -7, 2011. We arrived late (which we called in advance and was told this would not be a problem), and the female clerk charged the wrong amount on the credit card. She was extremely unfriendly and lacked in customer service skills. After a small disagreement, we adjourned to our reserved room. The room was very clean but is in DESPERATE NEED OF A REMODEL. We unpacked the car (which at check-in, we had to provide the license plate number) and began to settle into the room. My friend goes to use the facilities, at which point, she exclaims, 'I think we have heated toilet seats'. I mean seriously, is this really possible in a place like this? It was rather comical at first. Before heading to dinner, we stopped in at the front desk to inquire about the 'heated' seats. The male desk clerk, looks at us like we are absolutely crazy, and tells us that he will have someone check it out. Later that night the bathroom floor is slippery from the sweat DRIPPING from the toilet seat! To use the bathroom was extremely uncomfortable. We inquired again and were greeted with the same response. By day three we are told that they run hot water through the pipes in the summer. SERIOUSLY????? Has anyone ever heard something so ridiculous? They never offered us a new room or any type of compensation for our discomfort. By the weekend, the occupancy level increased and the parking became extremely limited where our room was located. Sure they have plenty of parking of the complete opposite side in the back of the motel. We inquired once again at the front desk if the cars that were parked in the lot were in fact paying customers. The response was that there was no way he could keep track of all the cars in the parking lot. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? We had to provide our license plate number at the time of check in. Bottom line this motel is not worth the money and the staff is unfriendly and rude. The accommodations are extremely limited, such as, no coffee pot, internet, microwave, need we go on! NEVER AGAIN!

Highly recommend this motel for a one night stay. Most of the area require min 2 or 3 night stay during summer months. This is one of the few who allow 1 night stay at a very reasonable rate. We stayed in the queen bed room with jacuzzi tub for 2. The room was very spacious and clean with nice sized bathroom with a large jacuzzi tub. It was lovely and relaxing after going to a show and walking around town all day and evening. We also swam in the indoor pool. This was also clean and water was refreshing. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We did not have breakfast at the motel or go to the bar they have onsite. But the area is perfect -You don't need your car unless you plan to go to the beaches - it is right in the middle of Main Street with easy access to restaurants, bars, shops, even walked to the Harbor and had an excellent lunch of lobster salad at Spanky's. We also walked to Melody Tent and had dinner at Paddocks before the show - highly recommend. Nice date night and overnight stay!

This past Saturday night I had the worst experience a person could have as a guest of a hotel. I checked into the hotel sometime after 6 pm and went to my room. After cleaning up I went to the front desk and asked the woman if it was possible for 2 friends of mine who had come down the cape to run the same race as I did could stay in my room and I would pay any additional charge .She stated that it was hotel policy that only 2 adults(which we all are, in fact married men with children) and 3 children could stay in the room I was given. She said that they could hang out but could not stay over. I said that is fine I understand your policy. We came back to the room with a couple of friends and were quietly hanging out when the night watchman/security guard knocked on my door and said my guests had to leave. I said fine and we all left and walked them back to the hotel they were staying.
When I got back to my room I find a note taped to my car saying I am being evicted and the security guard accusing us of breaking the window of the hotel room below us. I told him nothing could be further from the truth and I asked him to prove it to me that it was one of us. He said it was on video and I asked him to show me the video and he wouldn't /couldn't . He was being very confrontational. At that point 2 police officers arrived and could not have been more cordial and understanding of the situation. They did say because it was private property that it would be best for us to leave. They went out of there way in trying to find us another hotel to stay in for the night. I am pretty sure that if they felt we were at fault and broke a window they would have arrested someone for destruction of property. It was pretty clear that we did nothing wrong. We then went to the room to retrieve our bags I found that my car keys were taken by the security personal. This person had no right to touch my personal belongings. The next day I made several attempts to speak with a manager about the situation and was unsucessful. He finally returned my call this morning and was very rude to my wife and said he will be charging me for the broken window. It now seems that I will have to take legal action. As you can see in other reviews, previous guests also had issues with the manager and security. There are many great places to stay on the cape and this is not one of them.

Travelling with my husband and our 15 and 13 year old sons, we enjoyed the rooms that the Hyannis Inn provided. We stayed in a very roomy suite with two queen beds ( which is hard to find these days) and it also had a pull out sofa. The mini fridge in the room was a blessing for breakfast items we had purchased at the store. Typical motel decor but it was CLEAN! The owners were helpful when I asked for advise and directions to the Chatham area. It was a perfect location and close to eveything we wanted to do (Cape Code Mall, Whale Watching, Cape Cod Baseball, tons of places to eat on Main Street, JFK Museum) It is a bit of a walk to the harbour and the beaches though. For our first trip to Cape Cod, we were happy with our experience at the Hyannis Inn Motel. Reading other peoples posts......their unique situations shouldn't sway your decision to stay here.

My friend and I are here visiting from Canada. Got in late in the afternoon of July 20th. Checked in - lady at the front desk was great and helpful. Hotel is very dated and could use a serious facelift. Great location in the centre of town and close to everything. Our issues arose when returning from a night out down the street at about 1pm. We had two gentlemen escorts walking us home. The night desk person was standing at the from of the hotel staring at us as we approached the property. We got to our room and one of the gentleman asked to use the facilities before he continued on his way. The night person came over and stated that our guests had to leave the property immediately. Would not let them in our room to use the facilities. Made implications that we were women of ill repute. I was flabbergasted. Embarrassed beyond belief. Horrified. One of our guests was African American and I felt there were racial overtones in the reaction that our guests were confronted with. After our guests left the property I went in and confronted the front desk person who was rude, ignorant and small minded. He told me that if I didn't like his attitude I could check out. We will be leaving here tomorrow and booking into a more welcoming, hospitable venue in town. I am most dismayed that as a professional, married women I would be met with such a lack of respect!!! Do not stay here....

We had a great time for a quick Memorial Day get-away to Hyannis. The room was clean and spacious. We were happy to have the micro-fridge. We won this on an auction site for a great price.

Front desk was very nice. There was lots of activity going on- prom, a wedding, a bunch of high school girls' soccer teams....and the room was quiet anyway! My daughter really enjoyed the indoor pool, which was not at all crowded despite all of the hotel activity.

We walked to town- it's about a 5 minute walk to the edge, but about 15 minutes to the 'action'. Would definitely stay here again!

Here for conference. Staff was courteous, rooms were clean, but in need of being updated. A little higher in price than one would think for the "off season" but not a rip off. Just should be a little more updated, and well kept outside and in. It wasn't dirty, just tired. Lobby & pub area were nice for talking with friends, and lots of places to sit. Probably much crazier during the summer season, but I'd rather a place that was a little more up to date.

Stayed here for a conference for the second time. Both experiences were similar in that the front desk staff is downright rude and the hotel is pretty worn down. On the second trip, my closet door wasn't even attached, it was simply leaning against the wall. There is a horrible draft at the sliding glass door so it obviously doesn't seal well. The beds were very comfortable, however, with both foam and feather pillows. As others have mentioned, there's a weird layout with lots of steps - tough to navigate with luggage, much less with any type of disability. Banquet staff was friendly & helpful, as was the only waitstaff I came in contact with. The gym was very nice - best thing about this place. If I were going to this area on vacation I would definitely find another option.

We recently stayed here for a convention. We had second floor room in the building near the lobby which was in an ideal location. The room itself was clean and very large. It does need some updating though. The beds were very comfortable, the pillows were just okay. The bathroom in our room was very small but functional. Friends of ours were in a building on the other side of the putting greens. Their room was smaller than ours but their bathroom was twice the size. Enjoyed having a fridge in the room and a spacious balcony that overlooked the putting greens. Since we were on the second floor we did not have an issue with noise above. There was a family across the hall and down one room from us that had a child that cried, loudly. We could here the child when we were in the hallway but not in our room. The hallways and other areas of the hotel also need updated. The indoor pool was a nice size as was the area around the outdoor pool. The food in the restaurant/bar was very good. The food at our event in the function hall was also good. The staff was alittle slow and at times seemed disorganized (never did get coffee or spoons with our dessert) but overall it was a wonderful event. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. This hotel was very nice for a convention/conference or for one/two nights but not for an extended trip to Hyannis.

I just returned from a conference and truthfully, my room could not have been better. The bed was very comfortable, good water pressure and immaculate. I didn't encounter any of the difficulties that other reviewers have. Loved the fact that each room had a small refrigerator. Have to say that I slept very, very well (pretty unusual for time away).
The food served during the conference was very good and everyone (during a working lunch) just raved about the Reubens.
Easy access to lots of restaurants and the staff was helpful. There are generally comments at conferences about meeting rooms being too hot or too cold. Heard none of these here.
This property sure worked well for us!

'In need of refurbishment'

I just stayed in this property for 2 nights for a conference. The hotel is clean but so tired looking. The ceiling in my room looked as if it had been hastily repaired after a leak. The rug was clean but worn and in spots looked just plain threadbare. The soundproofing in the room was so poor that I could hear every little step in the room above me. The people were not making noise; they were simply walking across the room. The bathroom was certainly in need of not only an upgrade but also some basic paint. The food we were served was quite good and nicely served. The organization for the conference was nicely done by the hotel staff. I would not stay here on a vacation or even a long weekend.

'Could be worse'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed April 29, 2012

This was our second stay -- we play in a big annual duplicate bridge tournament there. We noted that the same spots on the carpet were there from last year. The maintenance really seems to be done on the cheap. A repair on our bathroom door looked like a blob of plastic. The heating/air conditioning system in our room was incredibly noisy, as was the fridge. We finally turned everything off. The breakfast buffet was unimaginative, and the coffee was really awful. But the sheets were clean, the room was made up every day, the bathroom fixtures worked, all of the staff were polite and helpful, and the view of the golf course was nice ... it could have been worse.

'Great place ...for a team'

Stayed here with my soccer teams for a couple tournaments and it's a great place for a team or even kids without a team. The pool is huge and golfing was fun. Not recommended for couples looking for a quite get away as the kids will break that up. Great for kids and families..... Ok for adults.

From the planning logistics to the actual weekend details to the onsite staff--our wedding experience with Elm Court was incredible. The venue was absolutely breathtaking and created the PERFECT place to throw the "best wedding ever." And that's not us being arrogant... that's according to all our friends and family. :)

We could not be happier that we chose Elm Court. The very unique ambiance and venue created such a special weekend for us, our families, the wedding party, and guests. We'll never forget it.

'Elm Court Estate - Romantic Dreams Come True'

We arrived at the luxurious Elm Court, a Vanderbilt Mansion and stayed in the great Berle room. When we arrived we were created by our hostess with a warmth that was so inviting. The great hall had a giant fireplace which immediately warmed us of the outside chilly air. Our hostess was friendly and so informative. We started a fire and snuggled in before exploring the mansion. The rate for the room was economically priced and considering the luxury it was a pleasant surprise. The breakfast the next day was lift fare but quite tasteful. Our stay in Lenox was so romantic and we wish to thank the owners and staff of the beautiful Elm Court Estate.

'Elm Court is magical.'

Intimate Opulence.
Elm Court was once the summer home of Emily Vanderbilt when Lenox was a gilded age playground for moguls and socialites. This stunning, yet petite estate is quite understated when you compare it with other Vanderbilt properties like Biltmore and the Newport mansions and that's exactly what makes it so accessible.

Where to begin? The rooms are all individually decorated with period antiques, (some even original to the house) and feature striking architectural details. Even the smallest room is airy and spacious. The suites are just plain decadent. The common rooms include a spectacularly adorned library with an eclectic collection of books on every topic imaginable,an all glass conservatory that overlooks the mountains and a truly awesome, enormous, walk-in fireplace in the foyer where we sat at night drinking wine and toasting marshmellows. You also have full access to the estate kitchen where we cooked dinner one night. Finally, the estate is surrounded by woods through which there are many trails and paths, several which lead down to a beautiful lake.

The managers are incomparable. Amy and Les (married couple) live on the grounds and attend to every last detail with grace and sincerity. We came with our 5 month old daughter for whom they provided a Pack n Play and a rocking chair in the room. Amy also booked a babysitter for us to have a date night. (Unfortunately our daughter got sick and we had to cancel.) I wish I could say that we were special, but I suspect that they make everyone feel like instant family.

Elm Court does not feel like a hotel. There is no check in desk, no valet, no spa. I find this to be part of what makes the experience so singular. At Elm Court, you don't visit a Vanderbilt estate, you live in one. The website is not as sophisticated as you would expect from a property of this caliber, but don't be fooled. From the decadent treats (procured from a local chocolatier) left on your pillow at turn down, to the all organic breakfast and eco-friendly toiletries, Elm Court is all about the details.

'A wonderful experience'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed December 4, 2011

Let me begin by saying that all the complimentary things said in previous posts about Les, the general manager, are absolutely true-- a warm, gracious host who made us feel very comfortable and welcome. Thank you for that! As far as the property, if you're looking for an ultra modern "chic" resort with no "flaws," then this place isn't for you. But, if you are looking to be taken back to an era long past, and surrounded in the history & true elegance of the gilded age, then book this place immediately. To put things in perspective, we're talking about a property 100+ years old that was fairly recently rennovated after 50 years of neglect and vandalism. There's a wall displaying numerous "before" photos, and the transformation to its current state is VERY impressive. The building, which I would describe as a type of castle, is very well restored, and while it isn't "spotless," it is gorgeous in its own right, tranquil, relaxing, warm, inviting, and in a beautiful location overlooking the Berkshire mountains and a lake. The view must be breathtaking during foliage season. I was hooked the moment I entered and saw a raging fire in a monstrous fireplace located in the lobby. Les said we could've roasted marsmallows in there, but it was large enough to roast a pig!!!! I felt like I walked into the Great Gatsby or "stately Wayne manor." We stayed in the Sloane Suite-a very large, elegantly appointed room with a comfortable king sized bed, wood burning fireplace, in suite bathroom with jacuzzi tub, couch, and small dinner table with 2 chairs. There was even another small bed in the room presumably for a child. We explored pretty much the entire mansion, and I think viewed all of the rooms. I would definitely recommend any of the suites as my top choices. The Vanderbilt suite, in particular, is absolutely magnificent, and I plan to stay there next time. Even the smallest room was very nice and appeared comfortable, but not all of the non-suites had private baths. Guests are given free run of the huge kitchen for storing food/drink, and even preparing meals if one so desired. We had no interest in leaving the property, and brought food which we ate in our suite in front of a fire. There's even a small room on the third level which had ping pong and air hockey tables. There was very interesting furniture and accent pieces throughout, giving the place a very elegant, tasteful, and subtlely upscale atmosphere. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place for children. BUT, Elm Court is a PERFECT choice for a short romantic getaway, and I can also see it as being an outstanding location for a special event such as a wedding. I'm by no means a "world traveler," but I have pretty high standards for when I do go away. Elm Court overall exceeded my expectations. I would unreservedly recommend the place, particularly the suites, for people who want to live in a fantasy world for a brief period, and can overlook a few small flaws related to the age of the building. We definitely will be there again!!!!

It's a pity the ratings only go to excellent. I would rate their service beyond excellent. Les and everyone working there are exceptionally nice and accomodating. Never had such an experience. Usually when staying in a hotel the atmosphere is kind of formal. Well, at Elm Court we were made to feel like this was our home and everyone was working for us. The rooms are new, beautiful, and immaculate. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.

I love all things Vanderbilt and was so excited to finally find a Vanderbilt home where you can actually stay! I was not disappointed. The mansion has a long history and is beautifully restored. I made reservations online with no trouble at all. I specified that I wanted a bathroom in my room since I know lots of B&Bs have shared bathrooms. Elm Court does have some of these rooms, so specify if you want your own bathroom. I cannot express how much I loved this place!! Les was our host & he was great. We talked a lot about the history of the house and toured most of it too. There are tons of places to walk on the grounds & it's all so scenic. It's close to the villages of Lenox, Stockbridge & Lee, so that's convenient. We only stayed one night (mid-week getaway!), had a nice breakfast the next morning & dawdled as long as we possibly could. The rooms are gorgeous & clean. Did I leave anything out? Oh yeah - I want to move in!!!

'Weekend at Hyannis Harbor Hotel Cape Cod ,Ma. Cousins reunion. 4/20/12'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 14, 2012 NEW

We checked into a bi-level unit . Thought it would be nice to have a larger unit to share with my sister & 2 cousins..... and yet be together to reminisence ! It was a cousins reunion. The first room we reserved had been flooded so they gave us a alternate. I can say the room was clean which is good ..but the set up had a lot to be desired ! The man problem is the usage of space. There was a bedroom on 1st. with a king bed & upstairs the 2nd bedroom had 2 queens size beds... very nice but on this unit which could hold 8 people....there was only one tiny bathroom on the first level. So any one who was upstairs had to go downstairs to use the BR facilities......not only that.... the sink area of bathroom was out side the actual bathroom....not very sanitary . The hotel is close to ferrys ....a plus , town is within walking distance if you are able to walk.... problably a mile. They do have a restaurant but it wasn't opened ,.... we found other places in a reasonable distance to eat at. On a whole being off seasoned....I think the hotel did Ok for us... they did give us a discount since our room was changed... and it was clean....but the bi-level units need to be re-modeled & diffienently of need of a second fl bath room. We had a great weekend , enjoyed walking into town & found cute places to eat. But , do your researach... there isn't too much to do in this area. Also we had a very difficult time getting off the cape due to traffic. ...2 hours delay due to bridge construction....so be prepared !

'A little pricey'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed June 11, 2012 NEW

Stayed from June 7th thru June 10th during a Men's Golf Weekend. Most of the group stayed at a less desirable hotel on Main St. Hyannis, but I chose to spend a little more and get place with a nice outdoor pool. The pool was excellent, but the room was tiny. Pretty much all I needed, but for the money, I expected a bit more. There was a small lounge in the hotel, several other lounges within walking distance, and a very nice view of the harbor. I was surprised to find out that I was being charged 14 bucks a night to park my car. The reason is that parking is limited due to the ferrys that leave the Harbor. As a result, it cost me to park my car in their own "private parking lot". What a scam. No, I will not stay here again.

'Truly awful motel - not a hotel'
1 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2012 NEW

Stayed here last weekend, and paid for a "harborside front" room, the room description is incorrect, the room had no view whatsoever, and when we complained, we were told that the difference between a standard room and a harborside front room is that the standard rooms may have a view over the carpark, where our room had a view over the air con units to the 'FRONT' of the property.
The pictures on the website of the rooms are incorrect, they show standard rooms with large windows and look light and airy, in reality the rooms have a very small window and are dark and depressing - cheap motel style.

Having read the horrible reveiws regarding this hotel , we went expecting the worst. Lucky for us, we must have gotten a renovated room. It was on the 1st floor in the back part of the hotel, a handicapped room. The room was as pictured on the website. It was clean, sparse and not disgusting, however there was a strange odor, kinda like lavender and mint. I checked for bugs...none that I saw except for a spider in the bathroom. Sheets were clean, looks as if the ceiling had been repopcorned recently, air conditioner and heater were updated. The bath was a good size, but lacked a vanity, they cgave you 2 small glass shelves for your toiletry...not enough. We had a deck which was peeling paint, the exterior needs work on the building and parking lot. The indoor pool was open upon request( rather odd) however extrememly old...but looked clean ( if you can get past the oldness), there is a Jacuzzi as well, but not a commercial one. I personally wouldn't use the pool. The lobby is very nice, and the outdoor pool area seemed updated and nice, but the pool and outside was closed due to the time of year. I would but it on a par of a Days Inn. It has a lot of potencial, but still needs work. If you go in the summer when the pool is open, pershaps then it will be a three star hotel (motel)...but if you look at it just as a room...don't expect too much. I was happy it was clean, and not stained or gross. After seeing some pics online, I thought I was going to be in for a horrible experience. I think we got lucky getting a renovated room. I smelled no mold in the areas we were in. The location is wonderful, walking distance to the Main St. and Ferry's. If you get a great rate it's worth a try.

This is what my reservation said, "Newly renovated guest room features one king size bed with one queen sleeper sofa. Harbor front rooms surround our center courtyard with outdoor pool area, Harborview Restaurant and Bar, new harbor view terrace, pergola and fire pit. These rooms are located closer to the harbor and ferry than our non-harbor front rooms."

The truth of the matter is the rooms were horrendous. Wallpaper was peeling off the walls. There was mold everywhere. The tile floor was dirty and stained. There was no cooking capabilities (no stove top, no microwave.) There was a fridge surprisingly.

The bathroom was atrocious. Dirt and mildew everywhere. When you were standing in the shower, it felt like a coffin there was no room to turn around.

As for the location of the rooms, saying they had a harbor view is like saying you can see the Great Wall of China from the Space Station. The harbor view you get is that of the ferries in dock and that is across a road across a parking lot across a pier. This does NOT count as a harbor view.

Overall, this hotel is a dive. Best advice I can give is to stay away until they actually renovate the rooms as they promised.

This hotel was so hideous we actually cut our 3 night 4 day vacation to a 1 night 2 day vacation! The rooms are so unbearably disappointing and filthy. The heater/air conditioner wall units smell so strongly of mildew they are a health hazard. The walls are paper thin and you can hear every noise in the hotel. The pool is so disgusting that you can barely see through the water and won't want to set foot in it. The bathroom looks like something from a 1960s horror movie. It's just downright awful. From the photos online, it looks like such a cute Cape Cod hotel, centrally located, easy access to the ferries -- which it does have -- but don't be fooled, it's on the same level as a Motel 6 just with a Cape Cod exterior. RUN FAR and RUN FAST.

We stayed here one night. It was relatively clean and comfortable for just the night. Bed was comfortable, room was clean, but bathroom had quite a few spots of mold around the tub. It was a little gross but not enough to completely turn me off to the experience. Water pressure was good, towels were clean and fresh. Complimentary breakfast was a little sparse, just cereal and things to toast, but seating area was relatively small. However, there are several restaurants serving breakfast within a few blocks of the hotel, on Main Street. The location to the busy part of Main Street wasn't too bad - a couple of blocks. Front desk was friendly also. Overall, nothing outstanding about my stay but it served its purpose.

VERY PLUSH) - rooms are large, a little outdated but for us it was fine - We don't require anything fancy - just clean, comfortable and convienent - this place is right on Main St - walking distance to EVERYTHING downtown - roughly 2 blocks from the stramship ferry to Nantucket - you can park and never use your car again if intersted in stores, sites, and eateries in downtown Hyannis - or drive to nearby sites - great place - will definately go back again !!!!!!!! - if you looking for quietness I suggest you ask for the 2nd floor

I think the title speaks for itself. I could go on a tirade, however, Trip Advisor reminded me not to be so expressive in my use of adjectives for this place, so I have edited my thoughts to just a few lines. Denied a cup of coffee in the morning because I showed up a bit too soon. Quite ironic when the desk clerk locks the door behind him as we approach, with a steaming cup of coffee in hand, and tell us there is no coffee until 8am, it was about 7:30am . Can you say lazy ? I could clearly see the carafe of coffee he made through the window next to the door.
Prior to check out, the maid decided to barge into our room, seconds after I got out of the shower, and screamed for her to wait. No attempted apology, it was 9:00 am , 2 hours before checkout. What the heck are you doing entering our room on the day of check out ?? Don't they know who's leaving that day? Obviously, not. The people running this motel are looking to make a quick buck. Forget about courtesy, and a people friendly business model. They only care about getting your $$ and checking in the next unlucky sap. America's Best Value Inn should screen franchisor's for people who really care about providing a service, and not just making a buck, sorry days lay ahead for the people of America....

We had a unorganized plan of visiting Capecod one morning and decided to stay in a hotel overnight . We found this hotel through a site and turned out to be the lowest on price in CapeCod for that night (atleast in the search results). I wasn't expecting much specially for the price we paid,and that being a long weekend. I was surprised to see that we had 2 deluxe clean comfortable beds,room was pretty good . Bathrooms were clean . And to my surprise they had complimentary breakfast (Which I didn't expect at all.) Plenty of parking space,Indoor Swimming pool,location is pretty good as well. Near by a couple of ferry boarding stations.(Just walkable distance).And yes the staff was friendly to all our questions . They drew us maps to places we can visit and guided us to the ferry's. Great Experience..

After spending, for many years, my Cape Cod vacations at a small family owned motor inn, last summer I decided to go right across the street to a "chain" motor inn known to cater to families with children and seniors. I refer to one of the "America's Best Value Inn and Suites" at 206 Main Street, Hyannis, Massachusette 02601. It has a cheerful, welcoming atmosphere; is well-maintained; keeps clean rooms; a gracious front office supposedly open and staffed throughout the night; and a small coffee room open for the seniors early in the morning. There is plenty of parking space to accommodate this two-level motel as well as a swimming pool. Its location is ideal for tourists. It's at the east end of Main Street of Hyannis, a busy shopping and dining district. Also, the price is right for seniors and families, but rates are really not that much lower than in privately owned tourist motels. I hope to return to "America's Best Value Inn and Suites" this summer.

I got a room for a night through Priceline just wanting a cheap, safe and clean place to sleep for a night. I didn't think that asking for too much. My bed smelt sour like, the pillows had stains on them as well as the pillow cases and they were lumpy, the bed was very lumpy, the walls had stains on them. My window was open in the bathroom when I got there which made me question if someone was hiding in my room and there was no curtain for the window so I had no idea if someone was looking in or not. The TV remote was slimy and the carpet was moist and felt dirty. When I went to the front desk to explain this to him he offered me another room, but at that point I figured all the rooms may be like this and said I don't even feel comfortable staying here and he said whatever, I can't refund your money. I would rather be out the money and know I am safe than laying in a very uncomfortable bed wondering if I am.

I thought it was a bad sign that this was the only 2-star hotel available for the Saturday night of a holiday weekend. One bright spot: some of the reviewers had complained about noise in the parking lot, and the staff assured me that it was an isolated occurrence and DID give me a quiet end room. Everything else? The towels were small as postage stamps. The tissues rough. The sheets very rough. The first night of the 2-night stay, my knee bled in a few obvious spots on one of the beds. To my surprise, even though I left a good tip, the cleaner did not change the sheets, just remade the bed! The breakfast was not too bad. The feeling you get in general is that they are out to save a penny.

Staff was dry but friendly and the room was clean. Was fine for the night after driving all day. Got a great rate compared to the other hotels in town and felt relatively safe. It's an old hotel but they are trying to renovate it. The only problem I had was the set up of the room--the door opened right to the beds and I didn't like that. Also, the walls are VERY VERY thin and I was awakened to the couple next door engaging in sexual activity. Good for them but bad for me after driving all day. LOL. But it's not a bad place at all--especially if you are on a budget.

Traveled with wife and 2 kids and needed a place to stay over in Hyannis before catching the ferry to Nantucket the following day. This is a _very_ budget motel. The room smelled stuffy at first. But it smelled much better after running air conditioning for a little while. The room was clean and all the appliances worked. The motel is a stone throw away from the Hyannis Airport, close to many restaurants on Rt. 132. Staff was very friendly and the free wireless internet connection was good (ask for password at the desk).

My husband and I had actually stayed in this hotel back in October. As we rolled into town, we were greeted by some lunatic walking in the middle of the road. My husband was hauling a trailer and had to lock his brakes up in order to avoid hitting this nut. So after that fiasco, we pulled into the parking lot, the whacko watched every move we made. It was quiet scary from the gates. There were a couple people staying there at the time and they walked out of their rooms to watch us, it was frightening. The hotel staff was very nice though, they did all they could to make us feel comfortable but the room was sub par. It looked clean but the curtains and bedspread has stains, I was afraid to walk on the carpet and our coffee maker was broken. I was a little afraid to put my head on the pillow at night so it was a restless sleep. We were up and out of there by 6am out of fear. This was definitely a hotel on the wrong side of town. It is a shame since the employees did their best to make it a nice stay.

Hyannis gets 5 stars for being a GREAT little town for strolling Main Street day or night. Quaint shops, wonderful restaurants, outdoor cafes, fun family atmosphere, and close to beaches. The Courtyard Resort is right off Main Street and in the center of all the activity! I've been vacationing there annually since 2001. While the room decor is dated, the resort is currently updating rooms floor by floor, but honestly, there is so much to do we spend very little time in our room when visiting the Cape anyway. All we require is a nice pool when we are there, (kudos to their large liver-shaped pool, sauna, & raised hot tub which we always seem to have to ourselves), and a clean place to rest out heads. They satisfy on both counts. They do also have a garden with BBQ grills and picnic tables right off the pool area for those who enjoy cookouts. Go and have fun!

We stayed here as a time share week, and we can honestly say it is the worst time share we have ever seen.
It is difficult to describe how poor this property is.
In the 1960s-1970s it was a motel and this is the best way to describe the property. Unfortunately, it is very obvious that very little has changed since it was a motel. The furnishings in the rooms must be the originals, and there are very few facilities. RCI withdrew this property from their books a few years ago, so if your time share company is still using it you may want to ask them why.
Our room ( and other rooms are similar ) 
 had a very old' tatty' sofa, full of cigarette burns
 the carpet was old, had squares missing, and again had cigarette burns
  had a pull-down bed with no duvet, bedspread, or any decent covering. There was a brown rough blanket- what we would call an ex-army blanket'
 12 thin wire coat hangers in an old wardrobe
 had two old electric rings as the cooker' which were loose
 had minimal kitchen utensils- odd knives & forks which didn't match
 had no wine glasses- only tumblers
 had no utensils for microwave cooking
 had NO iron or ironing board
 had NO hair dryer
 had NO laundry facilities  in fact there were NO laundry facilities on site !! I asked and was given instructions to go to the town laundry  well over  mile away.


The site 
 had nobody on site overnight from about 4:30  5:00 p.m. until the following morning
 had NO laundry facilities
 had NO internet
 The swimming pool only had two small lights on after dark -. it was difficult to see. A few large windows had gaps between the woodwork The windows were so filled with moisture it wasn't possible to see through them One night the hot tub smelled absolutely putrid. This was fixed for the next day after we complained. After a night of rain the ladies changing room was flooded, and full of towels and buckets for 2 days. The towels supplied were so old and small it was difficult to get dry. There were a half dozen sun-beds outside the pool which were so filthy we couldn't use them

We were looking for a Marriott property in Hyannis for an overnight stay. The location stinks as it is on a major road between two malls. The interior was surprisingly nice. The lobby and restaurant appear recently remodeled and our room was clean and carpets looked new.

'Don't go their if you plan on sleeping.'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed June 28, 2011

Room had a Murphy bed and a sofa sleeper. Sofa looked like it dated back to the 60's. When you sat on it you went down to floor. When opened up, very thin mattress curled up on all corners. All you could feel was metal. Did not open it up to sleep on it. Still had trouble getting out of it because you sank to floor. If there had been four of us, we couldn't have stayed there. Murphy bed was almost as uncomfortable. No maid service. Had to take out own trash and go to laundry room and trade in towels each day.
For an additional fee they would come in mid-week and vacuum. Screw that. Wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.

as an owner, I am annoyed at the reviews. They always tried to stay affordableand as far as being clean goes.they are.however, they do not do daily housekeeping  only weekly  (you can pay to have daily housekeeping)  but there is a housekeeping unit that has everything stocked that you might need, including clean linen and towels each day if you want them. There is a towel and linen closet in the unit itselfwith plenty of clean towels and sheets. I do take umbrage with people who want lobster but want to pay for a bag of chips! I have to defend the Courtyard as I have spent many wonderful times down there.and the location CANNOT BE BEAT. As far as being dirty or moldy  that is nonsense. The people who left negative reviews sound like very unsophisticated bumpkins who are not in touch with old cape cod! You can stay at the Courtyard and feel very comfortable and relaxed.

We were given a week's stay as a gift for me and my partner's 3rd anniversary. I will start with the only positive first and that is the location. Easy to get to and from key areas of interest.

Everything else is a negative and I have no tolerance for unclean floors, hence the sock reference, and soiled linens. I also found the showers to be akin to the scene from "Psycho" with such a drab and moldy atmosphere (not to mention the rust stains) the shampoo burned my eyes as they were left open.

Why were they left open, I knew you'd ask, well that is due to the simple fact that the dead bolt didn't lock. When my partner tried to find a maintenance man he was told that "we don't do that around here!!??"

Well, our week's stay turned into 2 nights after the racket from the hot water pipes kept us awake followed during the first night the 2nd night was another story for it seemed like it was being rented out by the hour???!!

The sound cans being opened, the smell of smoke, and noises as you can imagine....eeekkkk......followed by silence and then a repeat of the same was crazy! To make matters worse someone knocked on our door, and wouldn't stop, and when I finally opened it (chain attached) a sketchy looking young man with a nascar hat asks me what my problem is!!!!!

We high tailed it out of there the next morning and headed for an expensive, but clean, alternative.

'To be polite, it's a dump'
1 of 5 stars Reviewed November 6, 2010
1
person found this review helpful

We just walked in, and we are already checking for hotel rooms elsewhere. The door has been kicked in (the wood around the deadbolt is obviously shattered, and has been re-glued), the fabric cover on the sofa is ripped, the headboard on the murphy bed is broken, and there are stains on the linens. Out in the hall the walls are discolored and there are sections where the wall cover is peeling off. A family member owns a time share, has enjoyed her visits here in the past, and gave us this trip as a gift.

Obviously there must be "good" rooms in this facility (given the positive reviews and our family member's good experience) but I'm afraid I haven't seen a single thing I can recommend to others. While I could perhaps look past the shabby/ripped/stained furnishings... a door that has been kicked in is just too much. This "resort" is dirty, shabby, and sends out a very "sketchy" vibe. If you're a woman traveling alone or a family traveling with children give this one a pass.

(and I hate writing this since, as I said, it was a gift)

How wonderful that the Cascade is right there in a great location for economy minded people like me! The room was clean and spacious (and there was no odor). We chose not to spend $200+ a night for an accomodation that we were going to sleep in. We were out for at least 10 hours a day, every day. We never needed a car, everything was in walking distance and Hyannis is a super place to vacation for a few days. Call first, if a pool is important to you; there wasn't any water in it. If you get bad weather (we didn't) they have movies to borrow at the office. Ignore that picture of the dirty washcloth. Their towels are old but the owner says that is because some people tend to take home new towels and he is trying to keep the costs down. He has discarded the stained ones in the picture.

When my husband and I checked into the motel we felt welcome. The desk person was very helpful and nice. You can see two friendly heads of the owners dogs peeking at you. (so cute). Lots of brochures of places to visit in the office including information for the islands.
We stayed for two nights in a two double bed efficiency room. It was very clean. So, we were happy. It came with soap, cups, extra toliet paper and had a pretty nice kitchen set up. Bar counter and stools. It had a 27" tv, alarm clock, coffee maker, microwave. It felt like home and my dog skippy was very happy.
There was a big area for my dog to run around and you get to look at some vintage bikes.
The hotel is walking distance to almost everything.
My over all experience at the Cascade was pleasant and I can't wait to come back to the Cape. Maybe next time I will try there suite!

We drove down on Friday night, August 15th, and we were going to stay 2 nights, and when we arrived, i walked in the office and it smelled of dampness, and looked really messy. We walked in our room and it had a dirty facecloth on the floor, don't know where that came from. The beds weren't fixed nicely. The walls and ceiling were full of mildew. I would've rathered slept in the car, but it was already late, so we slept one night and checked out the next morning and luckily found another place to stay. The owner did not give us problems, which was good, but he probably knew that it was not clean. When we were leaving the next morning, there was a cat roaming around that looked like it hadn't eaten in days was trying to get in our room, it was meowing cause it was probably hungry. Obviously hearing from the other reviews, you are allowed pets, but it was a fast booking, so we didn't know that. Then we saw their pool, and it was green, I mean, if the pool isn't kept up to date, then imagine the rooms. I realize it is a motel, but i've been to other motels and they were much cleaner. Sorry!

My wife and I, along with my brother and sister-in-law stayed at this place on Aug 8th. Let me tell you the place is an absolute dump!
The owner/manager greeted us (barefooted) in a smelly reception area. As I opened the door to our room I found a dirty rag on the floor in the entrance and the SMELL....wow it was just horrible! It smelled like a bunch of dead pigs were under the beds, and the mold.....just gross!
I won't even tell you what I found in my sheets!!! OK I must(somebody's crustation from the previous visit) just nasty!
Please take EXTREME CAUTION anywhere is better than this place and I have stayed in some pretty bad places before but this place takes the cake!
We ended up in Yarmouth about a 5 minute drive from this motel at the BAYSIDE RESORT and we had a wonderful time I really recommend it there! There are lots of motels/hotels in Yarmouth which are 10 min drive from Mayflower beach which is an absolute beautiful beach!
Hope this review helps someone in the future, if so then my job is done!

My wife and I (and our two small dogs), stayed for one night. What you get is a clean small room with a frig and TV. Don't expect anything else like soap, ice, swimmable water in the pool, etc. The pluses are that it's cheap, allows dogs for a small fee, has a great location, and has bikes available. I highly recommend Perseys Place for breakfast (a 1 minute walk towards town) and Spanky's for lunch or dinner (a 10 minute walk towards the dock). The location seemed reasonably quiet considering it's right on Main Street and that people were coming and going deep into the night and early morning.

After a few minutes we were give our "right" room. This room was supposed to have 2 beds but only had one and there were no more 2 beds available. The room itself was in need of repair, the bathroom door would not stay closed, the tile around the tube was broken, among other details that needed to be addresed. While my daughter was taking a shower the water just turned off in the room. When I went to the front desk (because the phone did not work) the manager on duty gave me a free drink for the trouble.Some of the other people in our party, we had about 10 rooms total, had similar check in issues and room complaints.

Our entire soccer team stayed here during the Memorial Day weekend. Althought there were minor inconveniences, I was very pleased. The manager was more than accommodating and the lifeguard interacted/entertained the kids at the pool. The housekeeping staff cleaned up after and around my daughter who was sleeping after suffering from the stomach bug. Breakfast was well cooked and there was plenty of food. This hotel is in walking distance to many great shops. I would stay here again. Thank you for a great weekend.

We stayed in May. Used our Groupon deal. Was pleasantly surprised seeing there were some not so good reviews. Was expecting to find a run down hotel but was overall satisfied with our experience. (I guess everyone's standards are different). We stayed in the Regal room which still had a canopy bed even though we were told at reservation that the hotel was" recently renovated" and none of their rooms had canopied beds. The decor/linen and furniture could use some updating but overall we could live with it. Rooms were clean, and cleaned daily. The only complaint is the extra pillows by the closet rack did not have clean pillow cases (there was some hair on it) but I didnt make a big deal, I just didnt use it. There were some reviews complaining about no hot water when they tried to use the jacuzzi but our water was flaming hot!! (we stayed in room 236). We also had a $20 credit to the hotel restaurant. Food was not that great but we also arrived 20 minutes beforethe kitchen closed. Not sure if that had anything to do with it. We were just happy that we could eat seeing we had checked in rather late. Our appetizer was cold but our waiter was sooooo accommodating and made up for it. The DJ did not show up that night...bummer. But he he showed up on Sat night and the music was pretty good. The staff at the hotel were nice. The weather was cold and rainy so we didnt walk Main St much but did get some shopping done by car. The highlight of our trip was dinner at the Brazillian Grill next door. Bring an appetite, thats all I have to say! We also went on the Cape Cod Railroad for Sunday brunch. Paid $90 for two people. Food was horrible but scenery was relaxing. Wouldn't go again though. Not worth the brunch part. We were very satisfied with our hotel and our weekend getaway as a whole. I hope the hotel offers another deal for $99 for 2 nights in the Regal room.

When we booked the room somebody should have told us they were roofing this dump. We were made aware of this at 7:30 in the morning when they started a air compressor and started pounding nails in the roof. We were on the second floor. The place was 99% empty and they started ther work above our room. Complaining to the front desk was a waste of time as the hotel manager either couldnt or woudnt see us and they left the problem to her inept help who had neither the authority,common sense, or proper training to handle their jobs. After several phone calls from inept help to inept managment they decided moving us into a different room in a empty hotel wasnt an option but how about a a bottle of $4.00 comp champange. The phone conversation ended from inept managment to inept help when inept managment wished inept help good luck and hung up leaving inept help to deal with me in a much more agrivated state than when I entered. We came back at 5;00 p.m to relax after being forced to leave for the day. Still pounding on the roof .Went to dinner came back at 7:p.m still pounding on the roof. Went to front desk to request they stop for the day and was told by different inept help that they were
working till 8:00 p.m.At that point in time I had enough. I issued an ultimatum. Call your inept manager down here immediately,and stop the work in 15 minutes, because in 20 minutes i'm calling the cops theirs going to be a situation here. It was the only way left to me. The workers were off the roof in 5 minutes. I never did see the inept manager. If she is allowed to get away with this crap from her bosses whats that say about the rest of the company and higher ups. Is this the way the company is run across the board? I'll never know. Myself, my family, my relatives, my friends, strangers on the street will know how bad this place is and never stay there EVER!!!!
Just a few more points:
1) We paid $578.62 for a two night stay. You expect above average service for this kind of stay. As far as I'm concerned they stole our money, treated us like dirt, and have no clue about hospitality.
2) We paid another a $80.00 or so for two breakfast and one dinner in a restaraunt that was only open 6 hrs a day. ( 7am-10 am) and (6pm - 930pm). The menu had 1 soup, 4 appetizers, and 3 or 4 main dishes. Limited menu, inept hept, awful food, rotten service. We didnt eat there they can have the money, food poisoning, cooks spitting in the food, or bugs in our food seemed totally possable in this place.
3) They started working again the next day at 8:00am
4) It's not even all of it. I'm only giving the highlights, But you get the idea. DO'NT STAY HERE EVER!!!!!!!
Happy Vacationing , just do'nt do it here!

Mr. Peter L,

The situation you were put in during your stay is unacceptable and I sincerely apologize for the incontinence.

We have been working diligently to get the hotel in the best condition possible for our guests and between the re-roofing, painting and room updates we do feel that our establishment will be ready without inconvenience to our customers this season.

Unfortunately this renovation process left us with a few complaints, such as yours. The roofing should have not only been brought to your attention at booking but again at check-in and accommodating you with a room change should have been allowed. Although I cannot go back and change the stay experience you had, I would once again like to stress my deepest apologies.

We have just updated numerous members of our staff to assure our guests have the best stay possible. Even as we speak, there are new management members inspecting each room so that your stay is free of issues. With new management members in place, we can offer each of our guests the wonderful customer service they deserve.

Thank you for your feedback,

The disappointing: The room had a slightly smoky smell and as a lot of other people have said, the decor is tired-looking.

The good: Bed was comfortable; room was clean and spacious (we had a Princess Suite); plenty of hot water for the jacuzzi; location is terrific...lots to see and do within walking distance; all of the hotel staff I deal with were pleasant and helpful.

I agree with the reviewer who said this place would get another star if the decor were freshened.

Knowing what this place is for makes the bad furnishings, broken fixtures and pictureless walls almost worth it! My husband and I stay here for nights away from kids and so do 98% of the patrons. Could just as easily be found on Rye1 in Saugus where they rent rooms by the hour, but being on Cape Cod is supposed to somehow "class it up". Don't be fooled.. It's for one thing! They only need a box near the bed that accepts quarters.

Dont bring kids, the round bed and mirrored ceilings will need explanation!

Much cleaner suite than 2 years ago.

Surprisingly, the comfort level of the bed was very good and the jacuzzi for 2 was very clean!

Pictures on web are deceiving. Rooms are very OLD. I kept looking for hidden webcams because the rooms seemed a little creepy. We should've read the reviews before we booked. Each staff member we spoke to was disgruntled and shared horror stories of people quitting and bashed management. Our towels were not fresh smelling and many towels came equipped with long pieces of curly hair. It was a little disappointing having to share a bathroom with the yellow spiders that came out of the moldy ceiling.

Stayed here this past weekend (4/19 - 4/22) for a weekend getaway on the Cape. We booked a king room, but got a handicap accessible room with a queen bed. Not a big deal since the bed was comfortable. However, the room has no place to hang anything up. I ended up hanging my clothes on the handicap rails in the bathroom. Housekeeping was non-existent. We asked about housekeeping on Saturday, after not seeing housekeeping at all on Friday. The response was "do you need something?" The room we were in also had pieces of molding missing, mismatched paint on the walls and plaster by the light switch were the wall had been patched. The hotel was also supposed to have a restaurant (that was closed while we were there) and a pool (also closed). Not a huge deal to us, but it would have been nice to know those things so I wouldn't have packed my swim suit. The upside is the location. The hotel is right on Main Street in Hyannis, a short walk to the ocean, some great bars, restaurants and shops. I'll definately return to Hyannis and the Cape, but won't stay here again.

I was on my way to another hotel when driving past The Cape Cod Inn. It looked quaint and 1960 ish from the outside, yet I decided to look into the cost of a nights lodging. The rate was very reasonable yet I asked to look at the room prior to paying. What a very pleasant surprise! The room was in fact completely renovated from the entry door, carpeting, window treatments, air conditioning....it was all new, including the furnishings!!! NEW NEW NEW!!! The new owners were very pleasant and accommodating. This was truly a nice little find. Am returning to Hyannis tomorrow for a nights stay. I am very disturbed by some of the other reviews that I have seen here. Towels were new although not the best of quality and the breakfast....well lets say it was not the Four Seasons. As far as a clean and kept place at a bargain rate, don't hesitate to stay here!

Only had to stay here due to a last minute business trip in the middle of tourist season; no rooms available at other national-chain hotels. This place is a dump. Rooms are very poorly renovated. No table or chairs in rooms. No desks. No hangars. No alarm clocks. No iron or ironing board. Incessant housekeeping personnel attempt entry every hour, and finally ignore locked door and enter room. No swing-bar safety/security locks on the doors. Pool is full of construction materials (from recent room renovations). Took 1/2 hour to check in; check in process is very slow. Had to change rooms twice due to room (type) reserved by other guests during my stay. You have to pay for your room up front. Stay away.

In June, I made reservations tk stay at this hotel from July 2nd -July 5th with my daughter and boyfriend. I thought for the time and location, it was a great deal. When we got to the hotel, not only was the hotel closed, but the woman I spoke to once I relaized they were closed told me it wasn't her fault that I wasn't notified. Luckily we were able to find a cheapo hole in the wall hotel to stay in with such short notice.
Heres a thought, why not do renovations in the off season...
Never booking here again. Very rude and unaccomodating!!!

Unfortunately, she was not going to be able to make it so i called today (monday) to cancel her reservation for Friday. I was told at that time that they had already cancelled my reservations because they were renovating the motel. I asked why I had not been notified and the woman stated that a third party was supposed to notify me. I asked for contact info for the third party and she was about to give it to me. when i mentioned that she better not be lying as i will file a lawsuit she quickly giggled and stated everyone is suing them. then she refused to give me the info and hung up on me. i have tried calling back for more than an hour and no answer. no i am stuck trying to find a clean room at a reasonable rate 3 days ahead of travel date. i booked this room 3 months ago. i would recommend not to stay at this motel.

I phoned the hotel to cancel about 2 weeks before my scheduled date. A woman answered the phone and said they would cancel but didn't give confirmation numbers. They charged me even though I made the cancellation. I would never stay or recommend a place like this. Apparently, the $100+ charge is worth more than a good reputation. Well, they will lose a lot more since I am telling everyone I know to stay away from there and the Duck Inn Pub.

'COMMITTED FRAUD ON MY CREDIT CARD- Warning to Guests Even Thinking About Staying here- DON'T'
1 of 5 stars Reviewed September 14, 2010
2
people found this review helpful

I had booked this hotel for Labor Day weekend, when Hurricane Earl was coming. Not wanting to be caught in a HURRICANE, I called to inquire about cancelling. I was told it was $45.00 to cancel, so I decided to keep my trip and hope for the best. As the news of the hurricane was getting worse, I figured I would just call and cancel anyway. The male answering the phone told me that DUE TO THE HURRICANE, THERE WERE NO CANCELLATION CHARGES. However, they still charged me $45.00 to my credit card.

I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and my credit card company, stating that they violated a verbal committment for a refund/cancellation at no charge.

This is their idiotic, moronic response:

"this person called to make a resevation. which we did so for him. he states that no one told him about our cancellation policy,which i know is not true. once the resrvation is made,befor we hang up the phone the last thing we tell them is our policy.he called a total of three times. once in the afternoon on 9/03/10 the manager answered and he said he wanted to cancel. the women told him that there will be a charge. half price ($45) of the first night. once he was informed of that he stated that he will indeed come. his reservation was for 9/04/10. the tropical storm came on 9/03/10. his reservation like i stated was on the following day which was a very nice and sunny day. he could have made the drive up here,like so many of my other customers did. the second call was on 9/03/10 at night which was my shift. and yes i did say there would be no charge.but he did not tell me that he called earlier in the day and spoke to the manager.he was already charged by his second call because we doubted he would show up. he also did not state that his reservation was for 9/04/10 the following day. had i known that i would not have said there would be no charge. i should have checked myself to see when he was to arrive. but i didnt.the third time he called he spoke with her and she said that she would speak with me and if she felt that he deserved a refund she would issue one.the manage never said she would call back. and as for the manager not being reachable thats garbage. she is her 24/7 she has a apartment attached to the motel. thats our side of the story. thank you. "

This is a business that will still charge your credit card with their cancellation rate when they think you will not show up, even though you tell them you will still go. This is a business that does not have good communication amongst its employees because one was telling me there was no cancellation charge while the manager insists there was. This is a business that does not honor its verbal committment to its guests if it means gaining a few extra dollars. This is a business that doesn't care about its own image and has a complete moron write a response to an investigation from the Better Business Bureau.

Do NOT, under ANY circumstances, EVER give these people any business.

Honestly, I was looking to stay closer to Sandwich MA, but unfortunately, all the motels there were booked. A site had a link to the closest motels with available rooms, and I found The Cape Cod Inn. They had a room, with a king bed, so I booked it. After booking, I started to read the reviews of this motel and I became extremely anxious and afraid I made the wrong choice.

Once we arrived, it was a bit late, and a Saturday, so the street was filled with people. I'm used to staying places that aren't as open and next to busy streets. We checked in, they had my reservation, they gave us our room keys, gave us our parking permit and they filled us in on where our room was, where the pool was, and asked if we needed the wifi code. Very friendly and efficient if I may say so myself. They even gave us a 10% off coupon for their attached Duck Pub restaurant.

Upon entering our room, which was right at the pool, I felt relieved. The bed was made nicely, the a/c was already on and pumping out nice cool air, the fridge was very clean and bathroom was clean and stocked with 8 towels. The room was a little on the smaller side, but it had everything we needed. Everything I mentioned, along with a little closet, a desk and chair, and a TV with clear cable and a hook up for a portable DVD player or gaming device if you brought one.

Our first night there, we walked down Main St. You could eat, go shopping, and pick up any souvenirs you wanted all within a few blocks from the motel. Even go bowling, candle pin or regular within feet from the rooms. Our second day there, we went to breakfast and when we returned, our room was cleaned, bed made, fresh soaps and towels and they even took care of the beer cans we had scattered all over the floor. We even decided to take advantage of the pool. It went from 3 1/2 feet to 8 1/2 feet. Only complaint, and it's not even a complaint, just weird, is that you had to bring your own towel. That could be normal since it's the first time in a long time I took advantage of a pool at a motel. The pool itself along with the surrounding area was very clean. Nothing floating around, not to much chlorine. It was very refreshing. After dinner, we jumped back in and they even kept the pool open a little longer because we were having a good time. After swimming we sat outside our room on cozy chairs. They had tables outside some rooms too. Perfect for sipping on your favorite beverage enjoying the cool breezy Cape Cod air. Even had a few conversations with our neighbors.

One thing that bothered me, but not my hubby, was the ice machine. It was literally a box filled with ice and you had to scoop out yourself. That would fine if I was the only one sticking my hands in there, but I probably wasn't. I would have been using the ice IN my drinks, so I walked to White Hen and grabbed a bag.

Over all, the place was pretty nice. Sure nothing stuck out as amazing, but it served it's purpose. For us, as a couple, we're very easy to keep happy. Give us a clean bed and fridge and we're sold. Maybe after all these horrible reviews of the place, they got their act together. Or maybe we were just lucky. I guess we're just a couple of people that aren't bothered by mixed match light bulbs or a little too much paint on the bathroom tile.

The location was perfects since we wanted to be able to walk to most attractions and being one block away from Fenway park made even better. As for our room, we had the deluxe suite on the top floor that looked out over the city. It was awesome to have vaulted ceilings in a hotel room...made us feel extra special the whole weekend. Service was absolutely great as well...I forgot a toothbrush and the front desk had one at the door within minutes of my request. Oh and yes, the room even has a doorbell that any of your guests can ring to get you out of the most comfortable bed ive slept in, in a long time! Perfect place for a perfect weekend.

'If there's a downside to this place, I can't think of it'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 14, 2012 NEW

Because we have family and friends nearby, we travel fairly often to the Boston area. Up till now, we'd almost always stayed in one of the Kimpton hotels, but they were pretty high-priced when we checked them out for our most recent trip. So, based on its first-rate Trip Advisor reviews, and on its reasonable rates, we decided to try the Hotel Commonwealth. From now on, it will be the first place we check when we go to Boston. From the time we got out of our car, everything went right: the front door staff and front desk staff were both as friendly as any we've seen, and the room was one of those rare surprises that look even better in reality than they did in the on-line photos. Not only was it comfortable but quiet--very important to me as I'm fairly sensitive to noise. The quiet was all the more impressive when you consider the hotel's setting on a very pretty but very busy street: we had all the pleasure of being able to gaze out our window at the street scene, with none of the roar wafting up to us from below. The location is also great: we hadn't realized that, in booking at the Commonwealth, we were landing just about a block away from our favorite French bistro in Boston, and you can go in almost any direction and find a nice assortment of good restaurants and bars. The best direction to go in, though, is down Commonwealth Avenue heading away from Kenmore Square: walking along such an elegant stretch each day was one of the pleasures of staying here. If you don't feel like walking, however, you couldn't be any closer to a subway station: walk out the door of the hotel, turn left, and you're there in just a few steps. Also, if you go past the entrance to the subway, there's a good convenience store--something we always find convenient (fittingly enough) when we want to stock up on drinks and snacks during a hotel stay.

A wonderful hotel and fabulous staff. However extremely frustrating that management won't put out coffee in the early morning before the restaurant opens. This is the only major hotel I know across the country that forces us to go across the street to get anything. Hotel has 24 hour kitchen and used to have coffee. Very odd. Many of us work early. So they lose business for restaurant since we leave to find coffee and food at Brueggers and don't come back to eat.

'First time at Hotel Commonwealth and Boston'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 13, 2012 NEW

We spemt 6 nights at the Commonwealth Hotel in Boston and we were not dissapointed. The welcome from the staff at the front desk was warm and hospitable.
The room we were allocated was Room 216 on the 2nd floor, which turnwd out to be not a good chice as it is right above the Eastern Standard restaurant which at night pays very loud music, which was loud enough to be disturbing despite ear plugs.
This is when a good hotel comes to the fore. Having raised our concerns with the front desk we were promptly moved to a room on the 5th floor - bliss!!! - it was identical in size to the 2nd floor room but much quieter.
This made our stay in Boston much more pleasant.

The hotel staff are great, the location is good - especially the buzz when the Red Sox are playing at Fenway Park, also the T station fro the Green line is right outside the hotel, which makes travel to downtown Boston easy.
From reading other reviews of the hotel I would agree it will be our preferred place to stay, when we next visit Boston.
One caveat for intending tourists - the city of Boston charges 3 separate taxes which are added to your hotel bill and needs to be factored into hotel bills in the city.

That apart we enjoyed our visit to Boston and can say the our enjoyment was enhanced by the staff and amenities of the Hotel Commonwealth

We stayed with the Hotel Commonwealth for two nights and they provided fantastic service! Every employee was friendly and helpful.
The trip was a special weekend for my husband who is a huge Red Sox fan - I called the hotel a few days in advance to see if there was anything special I could do for my husband regarding the Red Sox (we already had game tickets) and the Hotel employee I spoke to upgraded us to a Fenway room for free! Very generous.

We brought our small children with us and had ordered an in-room crib and when we got into the room we saw they had placed a travel pack of baby shampoo, lotion, powder, etc. AND a Hotel Commonwealth teddy bear in the crib!

They also did all the things you expect from a 4-star hotel - hailing cabs, opening doors, etc.

It was certainly an expensive hotel, but very worth it.

This is where to stay for a first class trip to see the Red Sox. Great staff and excellent service. This place is top notch all the way. Pricey rooms and room service but worth every dollar. We got a "Fenway room" which had a view looking out onto Fenway Park which is one block away. The subway entrance is next to the hotel for easy access to see the sites. Only drawback is no coffee in room so you hafta wait on room service.

'A Fabulous Hotel'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 13, 2012 NEW

We stayed at the Lenox Hotel in Boston. What a wonderful and gorgeous hotel. I would say the Lenox Hotel is easily a 5 star. Everything about the hotel is outstanding, the rooms, as you can see they are very nicely decorated and immaculate, the lobby (above) is spectacular. The rooms are even equipped with a mini refrigerator which makes for a great opportunity for you to bring those fabulous leftovers. I'm sure that the hotel would not mind heating up your takeout for you.

The service is amazing. Very prompt room service served with a flair. There were a few things on the room service menu that was competitively priced, such as the mushroom pizza we rec'd for $10. Most pizzas are $10. Any small problem, you may have and the front desk is so happy and looks to serve your every want and need.

We had breakfast at their City Table and the food was very good.

I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again given the chance.

'cute with great service but needs some updating'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 12, 2012 NEW

yes the location is great, and the service is very good but our bathroom in the junior suite we had was really bad. Super tiny, bad fluorescent lighting, crooked towel racks, and water that never got that hot. I was staying with 2 friends and we all thought the same thing so it wasn't just me being picky, the bathroom needed some serious updating.

Another little entertaining thing that happened was we wanted some sparkling water and you need to call for mini bar items, as opposed to having a stocked mini bar in the room... so i called for sparkling water one morning and it never came but no big deal we were heading out anyway. When we returned to the room later that day there was a huge spread set up... 3 huge bottles of sparkling water and three bottles of champagne on ice with 6 champagne flutes. It was like they weren't sure what i wanted so just brought me all sorts of sparkly drinks.

All in all the hotel really is in a great location, and the staff was very nice, but i think i would try something else next time I'm in Boston.

'My home away from home...'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 12, 2012 NEW

Beautiful historical building, well decorated and spacious suite. Centrally located in the Back Bay area of Boston close to major sightseeing attractions and hospitals and some very nice restaurants are within walking distance. The service is excellent. I stayed at Lenox several times during the late 2010 and 2011, as a family member was being treated at a Boston hospital. The staff became my second family during that difficult time and my "grand suite" became my home away from home and every staff that I came into contact with could not have been nicer. Kudos goes to the management, the staffs from valet to chamber maids for making a difficult experience easier. To Krista in the front desk I am forever grateful for your care.

We were visiting Boston on a college trip and booked 2 nights at the Lenox. After arriving at night from a long flight, we were quickly told they did not have a room for us. They shipped us off to another hotel nearby for one night on them and then the next day upgraded our regular room to a lovely junior suite at no extra charge. There was a complimentary wine basket waiting for us in our room. They gave us free breakfast for 2 the next day and they even had a driver drop us off at the north end for dinner at no charge. They more than made up for their mistake the first night and we would definitely stay there again.

'Quaint hotel with fabulous location.'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 11, 2012 NEW

We stayed this June in junior suite queen-queen room. We loved this hotel and will be back. Here are the pluses and some suggestions for improvement.

Pluses:
1. Very cute historic property.
2. Fabulous location to explore Boston common, freedom trail, prudential center mall, Newbury st. We walked everywhere.
3. Very eager to please front desk staff. They were ready to meet any request. The best and friendliest front desk staff I have experienced.
4. Great extra touches, like stuffed monkey for kids, coffee and bananas in morning, cookies and tea in pm.

Suggestions:
1. Housekeeping was not to par. Need more attention to detail. At times convinced us to opt out of turndown service.
2. Wifi is free but so slow. Hotel needs better router.
3. Valet was pricey. At least make tips included in price would be a possible way to make the guest not feel as bad.

Overall I feel you can not go wrong with the Lenox. We will be back.

'Whenever I visit Boston, The Lenox is where I'll stay!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2012 NEW

SERVICE: The service was outstanding! The Lenox sets the standard that ALL hotels and resorts should follow. No minute detail is missed. From the time you check in to the the time you check out, the staff is genuinely friendly, hospitable and professional. As you walk past the Front Desk on your way out in the morning, everyone greets you with a warm "Good Morning! Enjoy the day!". If you're in a rush and can't stay for breakfast, you can grab a complimentary fresh coffee, tea and/or banana to go. For all you coffee drinkers out there, your coffee comes complete with a cup cover and sleeve! When the day is over and you're ready to hit the sac, you're welcomed home to a turned down bed with gourmet chocolates on your pillow. Heavenly!

LOCATION: This boutique hotel is situated in the midst of a multitude of stores, bars and restaurants. The area is filled with magnificently architectured buildings, with each building being different from the next. Everything is walking distance and there's enough going on without it being too much.

DECOR: The hotel offers an elegantly decorated, yet welcoming lobby, bar and restaurant . The rooms are well-appointed and have ample space.

ROOM: Anything you need to be in your hotel room, is there. There is a safe, a bar fridge stocked with complimentary bottles of water, 2 bathrobes, plenty of towels, a hairdryer, shower cap, shoe mitt, salon quality shampoo, conditioner and body wash, spa quality soap and lotion, cotton balls and swabs. The beds are oh so comfortable, covered in a light duvet, comforter, and a multitude of shams and pillows.

'Honeymoon Heaven'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2012 NEW

We're a Military Family and stayed here for our Honeymoon in 2011 immediately after I got back from Afghnanistan serving with US and NATO forces.

Firstly, thanks to the brilliant staff here and a big apology for not wriitng this review sooner. I emailed the Hotel from Khandahar to explain my plans for the holiday. They immediately sprang into action with generous discounts, priviledged rooms and a level of service that we simply don't get very often in the UK.

Our greeting was marvellous, the hotel is spotless and has a warm feeling of family to it. The decor and feel is rich, lustrous whilst also being friendly and accessible.

Food here is incredible. After eating drab food in a combat zone for a long time, my stomach wasn't ready for my initial foray into lobster sliders (which were the best and most fresh of the holiday) and an enormous breakfast at the Poor House down the street in Back Bay. I fell a little poorly - this in no way reflects the hotel or the Poor House Bar, just that I'd been eating boil in the bag for a long time and was literally straight from theatre! The hotel checked on me, looked after H and re-arranged our planned itinerary. No stress. When I emerged that night craving Guiness, the Solas bar made me the coolest, creamist pint ever and produced on me telling them that I'd felt alittle ill, unprompted and unordered, the best bowl of French Onion Soup with Parmesan crouton I've ever had. Seriosuly men, this was the Angelina Jolie of soups. Every sip felt like an elixir revitalising my energy. Glorious and on the sunny Boston street with my Wife - perfect.

The best was yet to come. I had planned a series of surprises for my Wife, one of which was a trip to the annual Tanglewood Music Festival in Beautiful Lennox County. John Williams conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra in an ancient Redwood Forest - magic. The hotel was characteristically Herculean. Thomas and the girls on the desk hired a car for us. The car was superb and cost us next to nothing. They even made us a picnic to stave off hunger!

Cookies and lemonade in a morning as you leave the elevator. Incredible food. Great service. Selfless staff. A decent, if modest gym for you Crossfitters out there. Rooms lavish, comfy and with spectacular views across the Back Bay skyline.

I can't speak highly enough of this place. It is simply magic, distilled. Can't wait to come back. This is Boston at it's best and really knows how to look affter combat veterans.

'Very friendly staff, fantastic hotel.'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 8, 2012

We stayed for a week in the Lenox in April last. The hotel itself is very well located close to a lot of the attractions. Newbury Street with all its shops and restaurants is just a block away, and the Prudential centre is 2 blocks. It is just one block from a subway Green Line station.
We had a Junior King Suite which was very spacious and well equipped. A very large bedroom with plenty of room to sit and walk about, a big walk in closet which had a fridge and small safe and a large well-furnished bathroom.
WiFi throughout the hotel was free and had good speed.
The hotel staff on the reception desk and the Concierge on duty were always very helpful and friendly. We had breakfast on three mornings in the hotels' City Table restaurant. There was a good choice of food and it was possible to request items not listed. The quality and service were both to a high standard and the prices were comparable to those of restaurants in the general area. The bananas in the morning and cookies in the evening at reception are a nice touch. The lit fire in the lobby gave a very nice warm greeting after a day out and about.
Boston is a lovely city and our stay was made all the more enjoyable by having stayed in this great hotel. It was a very nice experience and we look forward to being able to go back to Boston and staying in the Lenox.

We were there for a wedding and stayed 2 nights. The hotel is elegant & historic with tons of character. The room was spacious with complimentery waters. The staff was helpful & friendly. There is a gentleman named Jimmy that is 89years old and been there for 64 years. Sharp as a tack & had our hands full of helpful maps before we even got upstairs. The wedding was in the dome room- gorgeous domed ceiling. The set up s perfect for a wedding. The ceremony & reception dinner were in the same space but there was a happy hour across to hall to give them a chance to set everything up. Easy access to the T & great walk down to Boston Commons.

This is everything a 5 star hotel should be. Beautiful hotel, beautifully located on the Harbor. Spotlessly clean. Wonderful, courteous service: from check-in to housekeeping to the Concierges. Breakfasts at the Sea Grill - Many menu choices, food was delicious, service was very good; weather was gorgeous and we ate outside. Location is great - walking distance to North End restaurants, nearby inexpensive restaurants, Aquarium, harbor tours by boat; lovely, lively harbor walk. We took the Rowes Wharf Water Taxi over from Logan Airport - it was fun.

The Hotel is beautiful! Rooms are nice, clean spacious. Beds are Devine. Turn down service each night. Beautiful views of Harbor and City. Centrally located, walking distance to Quincy Market, freedom trail, North End. Airport sits opposite of Hotel across Harbor. Couple of downsides. Could not get a Taxi. They do not have an agreement with any service so there is always a wait. We missed dinner reservations the first night, second night ended up taking the train to Fenway after waiting 25 minutes for a cab to show up. Waited 20 minutes for a cab to the airport. Very frustrating. Dining is very expensive and food was not great. Do yourself a favor and venture out. Plenty of places within walking distance. No in room coffee service. I missed this. Thankfully there is a Dunkin on every corner.

The Boston Harbor Hotel is a phenomenal experience. We opted for the 555 package. It starts out with a desert tray awaiting your arrival. The room was plenty spacious and overlooked the harbor. The staff were very attentive. There are a few restaurants on the premise. We had dinner in Meritage. What a great experience, our package included a five-course wine sampling dinner. The food is tastefully designed and just as delicious. There is a spa, pool and fitness room. The location is close to many downtown activities and the concierge will help find a perfect fit to any schedule. We opted for a whale watch tour. Two thumbs up there as well. Our stay ended with breakfast in our room. The corned beef hash is delightful. A must try. This was our anniversary gift to each other. Our experience was nothing shy of perfect. Highly recommend this establishment.

'Nice hotel in Boston on the Water'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 8, 2012

Hotel has GREAT views IF you get a room that faces the water, so be sure to request one. If not, you'll be facing dull office buildings. Rooms are nice, very clean and roomy. All of the employees are wonderfully efficient and very anxious to please.

However, there are several areas that need improvement: the fitness center doesn't open until 6am, which is hard to figure out since it's on a separate floor and would not disturb the guests. There were several members and some guests waiting for it to open. Once open, it is a great facility and the attendants are very helpful and friendly.

The hotel had no flexibility when requesting a late checkout - unlike a major chain if you're a frequent guest. This was very disappointing but they were very courteous in explaining why. It would be easy to keep a few housekeeping employees around to tidy up rooms to accommodate a 3pm or 4pm late checkout, even for a charge. However, they do not grasp or embrace this concept.

The staff is the friendliest ever encountered & provide better service than the Penninsula or St. Regis in NYC, not to mention the Ritz or The Four Seasons in Boston. No matter how busy the hotel is, the staff always makes you feel welcome & often greets guests by name. The large dramatic lobby has a gorgeous old world feel and is comfortable for lounging with friends or meeting business acquaintances. The hotel is spotless, and turn-down service is unobtrusive and quick. The Sea Grill is a beautiful restaurant offering views of the harbor, and delicious food. One can dine outside on the harbor in nice weather, & enjoy musical programs in the summer. This hotel will wow you in every way.

My cousin and I travel a lot and Birchwood Inn has definitely made it to the top of favorite places to stay and revisit. I don't write reviews much but this is one I can't wait to rave about.

My cousin and I have been researching for a weekend SPA getaway to celebrate her big 'Five-O'. The glowing reviews on Trip Advisor definitely helped finalized our decisions. Needless to say our mini vacation turned out into an AWESOME celebration with a 'big bang' and fond memories (even without SPA treatment)!!! Our entire stay was 'exceptional' and more than our expectations. Our heartfelt thanks to Birchwood Inn, the soft-spoken & gracious Ellen (filled with passion & love), charming David and the quiet, friendly & adorable Quinn (our four-legged friend) for making this special celebration a memory of our lifetime  Keep up the good work and we can't wait to see you rise up to # 1 of 24 Lenox B&B and Inns List.

We arrived late on Friday evening. As we parked at our 'assigned parking spot' (feeling special, absolutely loving it!), we were surprisingly greeted by the friendliest reception of David, Assistant Innkeeper and Quinn, the adorable Golden Retriever!

Our 'Dana Room' was absolutely stunning, spacious and comfortable. We are definitely pampered by the attention to the beautifully decorated details, including the bathroom - clean and spotless! The bed, awww feels like sleeping on the cloud  it's heavenly!!

We were taken on a tour throughout the Inn. Every room is different and varied for different tastes. There's a huge library with a fireplace, lot of sitting areas, books, board games, puzzles, etc. You could choose to read, play or simply sit and be inspired in front of the fireplace. David also took his time to explain and introduce great places to dine and visit.

After we settled in, we took a quick stroll to the nearby little town where there are beautiful churches, a park, galleries, restaurants, antiques, spas, and wine and cheese stores. As it was getting late, we ordered take out from one of the recommended restaurants, the food was yummy. It was a wonderful treat after a long tiring day.

The next morning, we'd planned to sleep in but were pleasantly awaken by the delicious aroma of homemade breakfast and coffee. The breakfast menu was perfect for the start of the day  perfect portion, beautifully decorated (no detail was left unattended) and absolutely 'out of this world'!!!! Our gracious host, Ellen and her crew took time to attend to each individual's needs. They are very accommodating. (Ellen was kind enough to make extra order of her special Rhubarb Muffins for us to take home so that we could share with our loved ones.)

Within 5 miles distance, there's a premium outlet with incredible bargains. We didn't plan for this but we ended up filling our trunk and back seats with bags of clothes and shoes (will worry about the bills later). Later in the afternoon, we took a quick break back to the Inn just to have Ellen's famous afternoon tea/snack: homemade cookies and homemade ice tea. It was worth it. Minutes later, we headed out again - for more shopping... (unbelievable)! Time flies when you've fun. 3 days 2 nights seemed so short but it was definitely a good break.

To sum up: We left home with exhaustion and stress. We returned home feeling happy, vibrant yet relaxed, rejuvenated and restored.

Birchwood Inn definitely lived up to our expectations and more We highly recommend it.
It fits into any lifestyles, singles, couples or families and for any occasions. You can choose to do a lot or, simply relax and do absolutely nothing. The property was beautifully maintained. Birchwood Inn is filled with details that are incredibly unique and charming. Ellen (the Innkeeper) and David (the Assistant Innkeeper) were fantastic hosts and made everyone feel very welcome. The breakfast and afternoon tea was to die for, the location couldn't be better - within walking distance of the town center and the park trails. Last but not least, great news for dog lovers, this is a dog friendly Inn.

For the third time, I had the pleasure of staying at The Inn at Birchwood. I just can't begin to tell you what a pleasure it is.
Strawberry Rhubarb pie? Yum. Welcoming rooms? Yes indeed. A great night's sleep? You know it.
Ellen is such a wonderful innkeeper and her staff take excellent care of the Inn.
I marveled at the cleanliness of the shower and assumed that it was brand new. I learned that it is thirteen years old! Not one water spot. Absolutely immaculate.
Just wish I didn't live so far away.

Gorgeous country inn, beautifully situated next to a classic white New England church. The breakfasts and the homebaking are absolutely delicious, the inn keepers are charming and welcoming, and the library is one of the nicest rooms I can imagine to while away a peaceful hour in. It is within easy walking distance of Lenox village where there are lots of nice restaurants.
Highly recommended. If you are visiting the Berkshires, this is the place to stay.

Ellen,

I first wanted to say how happy I was to finally meet you personally, since our first email you warmth and kindness came across the web instantly. Now I see why so many of your clients return every year, it is like going home minus the stress.

Secondly, I haven't stayed in many B&B before but after this weekend I feel like I discovered a new world. The Birchwood Inn is the true meaning of cozy and beautiful. My room was so perfectly decorated that I thought at one point that it couldn't get better than that, then I peaked into several other rooms and all of them were equally as gorgeous but with a different story.

The service was flawless and the food was decadent (wouldn't expect less from the future Martha Stewart).

I hope you have a fantastic week and look forward to our next visit.

We loved our stay at the Birchwood! Our suite was grand yet comfortable with a charming old fashion fireplace. Food was exemplary, both at breakfast and afternoon tea. Ellen is a great chef and has created some unique breakfasts including a delicious Parmesan shell filled with herbed eggs. We were especially impressed with the common areas that are filled with beautiful antiques and furnishings. We had a very comfortable nights sleep and found the location very convenient. We especially enjoyed the fine dining that is close by and the park that is just across the street for hiking and exploring.

After having spent the first part of our vacation at a large inn in Stockbridge, we realized the true benefit of staying at a bed and breakfast over a larger hotel. In this case, the beds were so much more comfortable, the personalized attention to detail appreciated and the delicious breakfasts and tea that were included in our room rates really made a happy ending to our Berkshire getaway!

We would highly recommend the Birchwood Inn.

If you are looking for perfection personified - look no further. You will want to move in and never leave. The house is magnificent furnished with beautiful antiques. The staff is incredibly helpful, warm, friendly and efficient. Ellen (the owner) is a superb master chef who works with her staff to prepare fantastic gourmet breakfasts each morning. David (the innkeeper) is a real renaissance man, from making dinner reservations to helping you dig your car out of the snow. Rebecca is Ellen's "wing man" and makes sure you are comfortable and relaxed. Piper & Quinn are the permanent canine residents - who are the sweetest creatures you will ever encounter. The Inn is conveniently located to a host of attractions, places and activities, i.e.Tanglewood, musuems, shops, restaurants, parks and wild life preserves. Whether you want to sit back in a cozy chair in front of the fireplace or do some hiking or skiing - this is the place to do it all. It doesn't get any better than this!

We arrived during a parade which had closed Beacon street to auto traffic. We called the hotel and not only received great directions through back streets (which baffled our GPS) but their staff met us, sorted out the car and luggage and walked us to the hotel. It was my wife's first visit and we only had one night in Boston. The concierge Jonathan was fantastic. He arranged tours and reservations for a terrific dinner.
The room was beautiful, the location ideal and the staff was simply fantastic.
We are planning our return trip and will stay longer.

This hotel is a dark smouldering beacon of helpfulness.All the staff were extremely helpful and courteous.
We booked a studio room, which had a large bedroom area with sitting area and gas fireplace, it was all beautifully appointed. The room seemed like a junior suite, as it has a long entrance hall, off which is a bathroom, wash basin area and a small dressing room area. The bathroom had an excellent rainforest shower over a jacuzzi bath, and there were plenty of fluffy towells and products.
The in house complimentary car is a great bonus for getting around town on dull or wet days and the drivers are all really engaging and interesting.
The gym has 4 pieces of equipment, a treadmill, spinning bike and sitting bike and cross trainer and free weights, outside on the terrace is a hot tub. There is also a small roof terrace on the 11th floor with loungers.
overall very good.

'perfect location - great hotel'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 11, 2012 NEW

I recently stayed at XV Beacon for 3 nights and really enjoyed my stay. The rooms are extremely comfortable and well equipped - I stayed in a Beacon Hill studio room on the 9th floor, which was very large, with a lounge area and fireplace. The bathroom was spacious with beautiful towels and soap.
What really stands out for me at this hotel are the concierges Jonathan and Patricia. Each made a number of arrangements for me from restaurant bookings to hairdressing appointments and they were both so helpful and engaged. Emails sent in advance of my stay were answered promptly and helpfully and Jonathan made an effort to catch up with me once I arrived. It is the little personal touches like that that really make your stay. The establishments recommended were top class and they arranged for the hotel car to drive me to various appointments, which is a great service. Dinner in Moo restaurant was very good.
The location of the hotel could not be better, right near Boston Common in a beautiful historic area and walking distance to everywhere.
Highly recommended.

'High Class Boutique Hotel'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 4, 2012
1
person found this review helpful

XV Beacon Hotel (Fifteen Beacon) is a luxurious boutique hotel on the top of Beacon Hill in Boston. Walking distance to shops, parks and restaurants (everything is walking distance in Boston), this hotel is situated 15 minutes from Boston Logan BOS Airport (approx. $22 taxi fare).
The hotel is a 1903 landmark building with the charm of historic Boston but with the comfort of chic, classic and modern facilities. With only 63 rooms in the entire hotel, XV Beacon hotel feels like a home away from home, with friendly and helpful staff at the front desk and concierge. Each room has a cozy feeling including your own gas fireplace. We have stayed at this hotel twice in the last five years and even during our recent visit the service and quality remains superior.
During our May visit we stayed in room 404 (which happened to be the largest suite on that floor) - each floor only has seven guest rooms. Opt for one of the Beacon Hill Studio's you won't regret it - including either a Queen or King Bed, gas fireplace, large flat screen TV, large sitting area, and fabulous bathroom.
One other great feature at XV Beacon is their complimentary in-town Lexus car service. The hotel has one Sedan and one SUV that can accommodate either 2 or 4 passengers. Service is available on a first come-first serve basis; however if you know you are headed somewhere specific during your stay you can pencil in your time and location with the concierge. This is a fantastic service since taxi's are not that easy to find in Boston, and not as affordable as they are in NYC. Be sure to take advantage of this service during your stay.

Housekeeping turndown was a disappointment. The bed was fixed but wastebaskets and bath towels were not refreshed in the living room bath.
The restaurant was enjoyable for breakfast and I almost had the place to myself.
For dinner on Saturday, MOOOO was busy. The food was good. It was a bit pricey , $44 for swordfish with no extras. The best deal is to puchase the extra sampling at $18 for two people which included some tasty sides.

'Kindness from a Doorman'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 29, 2012

This will be an unusual review since I've never actually stayed in this hotel. However, I believe I have something to say that will recommend this hotel as a great place to stay. First of all, it is beautiful, elegant and has a terrific location. But, that's not my story. My story has to do with an employee that went above and beyond the call of duty to a person who was not even a guest at the hotel. Here it is:

My husband and I were on a cruise ship stopping in Boston for a partial day port stop. It poured rain during our entire visit to Boston. We stopped on the sidewalk under the overhanging roof of the XV Hotel. We needed a moment's respite from the rain and also, I wanted to take a picture without getting my camera drenched. We spoke to the two uniformed doormen about this need and they were very friendly and said, yes, by all means, stand under the porch. With a laugh, I remarked that this was our one day in Boston and this (the rain) was our unfortunate introduction to the remarkable city. One of the doorman (whom I will call Mr. M in this account) very kindly said, 'Wait just a moment,' and went inside the hotel. He quickly came out with an umbrella which he presented to me (I'd not brought mine, hoping the rain would stop  it never did!).

I was overwhelmed with his kindness and immediately thought, this must be the best hotel in the city and what a friendly town  and certainly, this was the most generous and kind doorman I'd ever met. The umbrella, by the way, was a tremendous help to me as the rain started pouring more and more. I will never forget this kindness and I will always have good feelings for the town, the hotel and that thoughtful doorman. Thank you, Mr. M -- you know who you are.

The website for XV Beacon Hill tells how the attractive building is a 1903 landmark Beaux Arts hotel, located on the crest of Beacon Hill. I can attest to the fact that the location is excellent for sightseeing. It is a luxury boutique hotel and, I'm afraid, on the pricey side (at least for my pocketbook). While I would love to stay there, I don't foresee that happening. Regardless, I would recommend this hotel to those of you who can afford a wonderful, luxury hotel with kind doormen and a very short walk to the State Capitol and the lovely green Boston Common park.

Kudos to XV Beacon Hill Hotel and the very kind Mr. M!

Simply put, this is a sophisticated hotel in a great location with a wonderful staff. We stayed in a Beacon Hill Studio on the ninth floor, and it was fabulous. I admit to being a sheet snob, and very rarely do hotel sheets measure up for me, but theirs did. The fireplace and surround sound stereo added to the cozy and romantic atmosphere of the room. (There are controls for both next to the bed.) The marble bathroom with rain shower head was also very nice.

From arrival to departure, this was a WOW experience and we have been all around the world and have experienced it all.
Our stay last month at XV Beacon was absolutely wonderful from start to finish. (The cab driver at the airport said: Good choice of hotels!) We have recommended this boutique hotel to several couples who live in the area and visited us. They agreed that XV Beacon is the perfect place for their other friends, too.

Location: 10++ (20 of 10) - walking distance to everything and everyplace; rooftop patio is fantastic; nice exercise/spa area; close to many excellent restaurants, including Moo, where we dined for dinner and brunch, and met friends for cocktails several times  all were impressed
Staff: 10++ (20 of 10)  friendly, professional ,excited to be at XV Beacon; helpful
Concierges: 10++ (20 of 10)  friendly, professional, knowledgeable, interested in finding the perfect places for us and things to do and everyone was SO NICE and made us so comfortable
Decoration; artwork, furniture, fireplace, etc.: 10++ - The rain shower head is relazing and incredible, and the water pressure is so nice. The bed helped us slept like babies each night; the fireplace was comforting and warm; the entire room and hotel was decorated to perfection. In-house Lexus and driver: 10++ (20 of 10)  impressive; excellent and caring drivers; comfortable cars. Very nice perk for guests.
Housekeeping: 10++ (20 of 10)  SPOTLESS; considerate; professional; friendly, etc. LOVE the ability for us to indicate whether we needed or wanted housekeeping service. Very considerate feature that we appreciated.
Room comfort: 10++ Ultra QUIET ROOM on the back corner. The shower head is PERFECT.
Water pressure is AMAZING. Nice bathrobes, towels and linens. Also liked the vases in the rooms - which we filled with tulips from the local market.
We definitely will return.
MAJOR COMPLIMENTS: we arrived at about 6 am and were immediately welcomed cheerfully and then checked in and given a most-excellent room. That is amazing (most hotels sigh and tell their guests that check in is 3 pm). The staff is THE BEST, in a beautiful location and facility, and they all are so happy to be there.
Many thanks for making our vacation incredibly wonderful.

We have been privileged to stay in wonderful hotels all around the world for both business and pleasure but nowhere has enchanted us to the extent of XV Beacon. We went to New York last month and couldn't resist a train ride to Boston for Easter and a return visit. We had our favourite corner room, ate in the restaurants - Teatro and Sorrelina - owned by the same people who own the hotel and where we always return, and met up again with the wonderful Michael, Head Concierge and all his colleagues. This is a hotel where the staff really do care. They even tracked down a Newcastle football match that wasn't on the television back in England - how's that for attention to detail?! We "love them to bits". You will too.

Lobby was very nice and plenty of seating to lounge around. Rooms were decent and beds comfortable. It was nice that they served Starbuck's coffee and pastries as well. Loved how a shuttle arrived every 15 minutes and took us to Universal Citywalk. If attending Universal Studios, it's just a short walk from the drop-off at Citywalk. Shuttle operated late probably because it was Memorial Day weekend. Location was definitely ideal.
As for a mixed 3 stars review, this was based on the following issues we experienced during our 2 day stay at the hotel. On the first night, we had requested a set of extra towels. An hour had passed, but yet no one had come by. Since we had to leave for dinner, called housekeeping back to cancel the request. The next day, made the same request. Same issue after 30 minutes had gone by. Called housekeeping again and explained the previous night's issue. I was told that the service elevator was broken and that someone should be coming up very soon. Knock on the door and this older gentlemen was breathing heavy and apologized for the delay. Second issue: the kids wanted to go swimming Sunday afternoon, however, there was a 21 and over pool party from 12-6pm. The scene was definitely like a spring break event with music, dancing, and alcohol. We were told that this pool party event started about a week ago and might go on through summer. The gentlemen at the concierge desk explained that we could use the Hilton swimming pool. To get there, had to walk across the front of the hotel past the parking structure, up the elevators to the Hilton, and then to their swimming pool. A bit inconvenient, but end result was the kids got to swim.
If we plan to visit Universal again, we will probably give the hotel another chance. As a note, got to use my SPG cash and points. Points does not cover tax and parking fee though.

We've only stayed in Sheratons a few times, so we are a Starwood member. But we never thought it would pay off like it did. We needed to stay in this location for business (unfortunately we didn't even get over to Universal Studios.) But I was concerned about being in an expensive city with no free breakfast and a teenage son who is always hungry. When we checked in, we were upgraded to a higher floor for Starwood members, and given a pass for free breakfasts and free snacks and beverages in the evening. The food was varied and delicious, and very filling. The rooms were large and very comfortable, although the bathrooms are quite small. The hotel is a bit worn at the seams, but has been redone. We ate in the hotel dining room twice and it was quite good. The pool area is small and a bit worn and shady, but it was nice to be outside. I would definitely recommend this hotel. (But no free internet service in the rooms.)

It was very small and the noise from the freeway made it difficult to sleep. It seems like they could have used thicker glass on the windows. Also it was annoying that for the price, free Wi fi was not included. Anyway, if you really want to be close to Universal, staying here might make sense. Just be sure to ask for room on the quieter side of the building. Otherwise, I might recommend the Beverly Garland hotel which is not as close to Universal but does still have a free shuttle. For less money, we had a much bigger and quieter room there with free Wi-fi.

the next day we experianced some funky gas smell in the room and notified them , when they checked it out -they told us on top floor above was a garden restaurant and directly above was the kitchen so that is what we smelled.. needles to say we changed the room to the same one but on the 12 floor and that was OK.they were very nice about it and for our trouble we got access to the club room and that was great ! Overall we had a very good time there, everyone was very nice and if we go to LA again will stay there..

We stayed here 3 nights and honestly I was a bit skeptical upon arrival. Our flight came in early in the morning so we headed to the hotel to drop our bags and head out to Universal Studios. (Quick note: it is a good 40 minute drive from LAX or about an $80 cab fare. Might be worth renting a car if you are comfortable manuevering L.A. highways) The bell desk was very helpful in storing our bags while we hopped the free shuttle up to the park. I was also happy to see an updated, comfortable lobby that looked very inviting and clean. Aside from a long, crowded day at the park, we were happy to return via shuttle to the hotel for a quick check in.
After a slight misunderstanding on what type of room I thought we would have have, we settled into a room on the second floor, which is one flight (maybe 8-9 steps) down to a clean and well lit hall to our room, which had a balcony facing the pool. (I thought that we would have a "walk-out" room, when I originally booked, but upon review of my reservation, I noticed that it was either a patio OR balcony facing the pool.) I was actually glad we'd gotten this location for several reasons - no elevator wait, close to exit for the pool, one flight back up to the main floor with the bar, concierge, front desk and gift shop. Actually I would suggest that if you are ok with a few stairs, this is the best way to go. Given that other reviews complain of the long elevator waits, we never had to experience any of that. The hotel is older so I am not used to the lack of counterspace in the bathroom, but it was not unmanageable. So for the rest of the review, I will just give a short list of the pros and cons.
The room itself - clean beds and bathroom. Carpet could use a good cleaning but no worse that any other hotel. The trim was coming off (or completely gone) on the doorway. It was odd that it had not been repaired or replaced. But again - not that big of deal. What I was disappointed in was the lack of refridgerator and tiny ice bucket for use. Also, I would have liked a table or another chair in the room, as I don't like to have anything sit on the floor in a hotel (ie packages, purse, bags) Really these points were more of an inconvenience than anything.
Staff - The night we arrived there was loud dance music coming from somewhere still going strong at 11 pm. I called once to have it resolved but 20 minutes later nothing had been done. I then got out of bed and dressed and went to the front desk personally. I stood there while security was called and it was resolved within about 5 minutes. Had my room not been in this location, I don't know that I would have gotten up and traveled the elevator and through the lobby to complain. Housekeeping was courteous and helpful in the hotel and at the pool.
Gift shop/bar/restaurant - all a bit pricy, but you are paying for convenience and anyone staying at any hotel should be aware of that and deal with it. We had room service for breakfast and it was around 40.00 for the three of us - yes, not the free continental breakfast you would find other hotels, but if you have ever had room service before in any hotel - its pricy but convenient. Of course using the amenities such as these at any hotel is an option so this shouldn't have much weight on considering the hotel itself.
Business center - convenient, plenty of computers and free. Of course I would have preferred free wi-fi... who wouldn't? Again, just an inconvenience, not a tragedy.
Location - you can't beat this for the price. We realized on day 2 that the walk was easy and only about 5 minutes (and a little bit of good exercise - esp after 2 or 3 trips back and forth)
Concierge was helpful in getting us an airport car service and reservations to Warner Bros. studios.
This is not a five-star hotel but definitely convenient, clean and worth the price for those things alone. If you are a complainer and specifically look for things that aren't perfect, stay somewhere else. If not, this hotel will work for you.

'Beautiful Ballroom'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 29, 2012

I didn't get a chance to actually stay at this hotel, but I attended a wedding here this past weekend. The ceremony took place outdoors in a beautiful garden. With the trees surrounding the site, the weather was cool and there was ample shade to make seating comfortable. The only unfortunate thing about the location was that there was a nearby bell that rang maybe every ten minutes (similar to a school bell). A little distracting, but not horrible.

After the ceremony, there were plenty of banquet staff strategically placed to guide guests to the ballroom. It was kind of a pain to wait for the slow elevators to take groups ten at a time up to the top floor, but because of the staff, it went smoothly.

The ballroom itself was BEAUTIFUL! I've been to a lot of weddings, and this was my favorite reception site so far ... even prettier than where I got married! The ceiling has twinkling lights that look like stars. The floor to ceiling windows on BOTH sides of the ballroom offered great views of either the mountain or the city. You can see the new Transformers ride at Universal Studios, too!

I can't say enough about the banquet servers. Imelda, who was serving our table, was so great. She cleared out our glasses and plates efficiently and without getting in the way. My water glass was NEVER empty. She even showed us a quick dance move to our delight.

The food was delicious, especially the salmon. I also loved the lemon bars.

If the service you get while staying overnight at this hotel is as good as it was during the wedding, then I would definitely recommend staying here.

Stayed there for business 5/18-5/21, and I always stay at Sheratons when I travel. There were 8 of us staying there and we were very disappointed in the service at this hotel. Everything took forever. When we went to the bar for drinks it was not very busy (two other people at the bar) and it still took 20 min for the bar tender to get us our drinks, once empty, we had to flag down the bartender to get a second drink. This level of service was repeated two nights later, when it took so long for the bar tender to get our drink order that the kitchen was closed by the she came back. We ended up ordering out pizza. Breakfast was no different. The one lady who was there disappeared for 20 min, so again we had to wait. We asked the bellman to watch our suitcases while we got breakfast go to the morning we were leaving and could not find him for 15 min after. We had negotiated free parking for the 8 of us, and were still billed, so we had to fix that as well.

As for the rooms, they are very small. The bathrooms are tiny! Almost no counter space and the door hit the toilet. Needless to say, we will not be staying at this Sheraton again.

'Never Let Down at Four Seasons'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 13, 2012 NEW

It is a Four Season Hotel so the expectations are high, and once again this hotel didn't disappoint.

The lobby is understated and classy, reeks of class and money, but at the same time is inviting. This is a rare combination that makes you feel immediately at home.

The front check in staff is world class. I found them to be kind and caring and genuinely interested that I have a positive stay. The only way that I can put it is that seemed personally invested in my happiness and comfort. Great first impression.

The rooms, though on the smaller side, are gorgeous. The design is elegant, not terribly modern but much like the living room of an extraordinarily rich aunt. Classic.

The beds are simply divine and encourage loungy mornings after drinking too much wine at the Bristol Lounge.

Though not the same since Aujourd Hui left, it is still in a prime location in Boston...near both the business centers of the city and (if you're a tourist) near the "sights"

Highly recommended

'Nice family stay'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 11, 2012 NEW

We stayed over Memorial Day weekend with our children and parents. While the suite was priced a bit high for the size of it, my parents were able to book a room at half price so it worked out for that reason. Check in was a breeze, kids were able to choose a toy and backpack from cart (booked kidcation package), and we were able to check in at the time I told reservationist we would arrive which was much earlier than listed check in time. Once we got to room, kids were excited to see the special soaps and diapers, etc. that were left for them. Housekeeping even wrote their names on inside tub with the bath crayons. My 13 year old was impressed by this. We left to explore once dropping off things and returned at 4 to find special snacks and drinks left for all 3 kids. A root beer, whoopie pies and m&m's for eldest, a juice box and age appropriate snack tray for 3 year old, and special crackers and bib for baby. All very nice touches!
We had dinner, (all of us), in Bristol Lounge and our waiter was very accommodating to kids. Even brought out a portable DVD player for our son. Helpful with his wine ideas and food choices. Food was very good. Disappointed to see some people wearing their shorts and t-shirts, come on, at least put on something nice! After dinner we had the "icecream man" come to our room and we all were able to have him make us sundae's. Cute idea except kids were ready to sleep then.
Don't hesitate to come if you have children or if not. The children are not running around yet the hotel truly made us feel welcome which doesn't always happen with 4-5 star places. We are looking forward to coming again as we felt so welcome and Memorial Day weekend seemed to be a great time as many had left the city. I am sure they try to keep people with kids away from rooms of single or business travelers so you won't be disturbed. Love the ability to walk everywhere in this city.

'THE BURGER!!!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 8, 2012 NEW

Stayed at Four Seasons Boston while in town for a friend's birthday. Our Four Seasons Executive Suite was fabulous! The hotel is in the perfect location on Boston Common and so close to the Newbury Street shopping district and so many other things! Bristol Lounge was awesome. We had the burger (both of us ordered the burger) on Saturday and it was amazing. The truffle fries that come with it were so fantastic as well (my boyfriend says "like heaven"). I loved it so much I actually ordered it again on Monday! Over the course of our stay we also tried the Short Ribs Reuben, Golden Tomato Gazpacho, Crab Chowder, Let's Split it Cake, and a chocolate praline cake (I can't remember the name), as well as some fabulous drinks. The Moscow Mule was perfection. They stuff olives with bleu cheese upon request for the dirty martinis, and my salted caramel martini was an amazing liquid dessert. We had such a great stay here. It was my 2nd time here and we will definitely be back.

'Four Seasons - Boston'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 7, 2012

We stayed in the Four Seasons Boston in May 12 for 4 nights. The hotel is lovely and our room was spacious with an extremely comfortable bed and pillows. There is a turndown service so when you come back from a long day walking around the sites of Boston we had lovely fresh towels and slippers by the bed. Very clean and a great place to stay. The pool and fitness area was also good. The staff in all areas were at all times courteous and extremely helpful, particularly concierge staff who provided us with any information we needed. Within walking distance of the Prudential shops and restaurants. We very much enjoyed our stay and would definitely return.

Amazing experience from top to bottom. Genuine, sincere, concern for comfort of my visit was consistent with all the staff. Hotel is lovely and the pool is clean and well appointed. My room was lovely, although the air shaft next door did make a wooshing sound all night, not sure anyone can do anything about that. The food at the Bristol is outstanding and the staff go above and beyond the call of duty.

'Excellent, but expensive'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 6, 2012

I stayed here for one night in May on a business trip; my first time at this hotel. Four Seasons is reliably good, both in terms of the quality of the rooms (always important when you're on a tiring business trip) and the level of service that you receive. One small annoyance is the price of the basics; $12 for a cup of tea is crazy and unless you leave the hotel to find a coffee shop there is no option because there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms.

We had dinner in the restaurant and it was excellent; great food and very good (and unobtrusive) service.

We stayed at the Nine Zero for three nights during a break to celebrate my 'special' birthday. Unfortunately, we had two children in tow. I say unfortunately because the hotel is ideal for a romantic break with that special someone. That being said, the children loved the hotel too - although not specifically a children's hotel, they were given a goodie bag and made to feel welcome by the hotel staff. The hotel is conveniently situated for the Harbour and the Freedom Trail passes right outside the front door. Highly recommended.

What a great place to stay! The hotel is centrally located, next to the Boston common and the Park Street subway station. The decor is funky and the views from the upper floors fantastic (we were on the 17th floor). Very comfortable beds, very quiet at night, and lots of hot water. The staff is great - Thomas, the Lead Concierge was super, and the front desk staff and porters were friendly and obliging. The hotel has a hosted wine hour every day from 5 to 6. This was our second stay in a Kimpton and when I travel, I will be looking for Kimpton hotels in other cities.

We just stayed at the Nine Zero and really enjoyed this hotel. It is in the perfect location for exploring the city - most things were within walking distance or a short cab ride away. We were also just a block away from a T stop. There were some great places within a few blocks of the hotel - We did dinner at Sculley's which was excellent, lunch at Sam LaGrassa's (do not miss this!), and had drinks at Beantown and the Hub Pub (another favorite).

The staff were very friendly and fast in accommodating our requests (late check out, etc.) and the concierge was really helpful in recommending restaurants to try. We also loved the wine happy hour. The rooms were very clean and overall it was quiet. We would definitely recommend this hotel!

Nine Zero was fantastic! From Logan Airport, we decided to take a water taxi into Boston. I emailed the concierge ahead of time to ensure that I had the right details. Thomas responded very quickly to confirm my arrangements and provided walking directions from Long Wharf to the hotel. It's very easy to navigate - even with luggage! We arrived at the hotel during the 5-6pm wine reception. We chatted with the staff and got some great recommendations for dinner. Our entire stay (3 nights) we had very friendly and attentive service. The bed was extremely comfortable and though we didn't try room service, we were tempted by the menu - everything sounded really good (from associated restaurant). The hotel is very central - close to Boston Common, the Waterfront.... We walked everywhere - TD Garden for a Celtics game, Newbury Street shopping, Little Italy in the North End .... Definitely recommend this hotel.

'Fantastic Hotel Choice'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 7, 2012
3
people found this review helpful

I'll try to cover the items I think are important when looking for a hotel.

Location: it really is one of the best locations in the city. You can walk pretty much anywhere. Or, if you need to go further, the subway is very close and can get you to Cambridge, Copley Square, Fenway, etc., in just a few minutes. Boston Common is one block away. Also within easy walking distance: Beacon Hill, Downtown, North End (Little Italy), Faneuil Hall, Theater District.

Airport Access: You can take a taxi from the airport for about $20. Or you can take the subway. Tip: if you're going to be there for more than a couple days, buy a "Charlie Ticket" at the subway station for unlimited rides.

Room: The room was a very good size (this is third hotel I've stayed at in Boston in the last couple years and they were all really great. This one stood out because of the size of the room - which I did not expect from a "boutique hotel"). There were two queen beds. We were on the 13th floor (may be the first hotel I've stayed in that doesn't "skip" the 13th floor). The style and decor is very modern, yet comfortable. The beds were great. The shower had good water pressure and never ran out of hot water. The fridge is stocked with the normal uber-expensive sodas and liquor, so we just pulled all that stuff out and used the fridge to chill beer that we bought at the Boston Wine Exchange around the corner (another great tip for beer lovers: go to the Boston Wine Exchange - the selection is very good). Another tip for beer lovers: check out the Barracuda Tavern just steps away from the hotel. It's a great little bar. Very laid back. Good food and a great beer list.

My biggest complaint: expensive wifi (this seems to be a trend with the higher end hotels (where it seems to be free at a cheap motel anywhere)).

Service: The hotel staff were all very pleasant and professional. I asked for a couple things to be brought to the room and they were delivered right away. Maps were given on request. There are large containers of water in the lobby with either lemon or orange in them. It was a good refreshment upon arriving back at the hotel after walking around all day. There is a wine reception open to all guests from 5p to 6p each day. The valet/doormen/bag handlers/etc. were all very helpful with getting taxis, storing bags, etc. The housekeeping was absent when appropriate and available when appropriate.

Overall: I would definitely stay here again. It's a very comfortable hotel with great service in a perfect location.

'First impression of a Kimpton....a Delight!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 4, 2012

people found this review helpful

I tend to be boring and stick to what I know (Hiltons and Marriotts), but Boston is trickier because the most beloved properties are boutiques. So, I tried a Kimpton for the first time. The hotel chain is excellent.

I arrived early before my room was ready. They kindly called me on the phone to let me know when it was time to check in. I made sure to join the Kimpton rewards program - got me a $10 voucher to the minibar and free WIFI.

What sets this hotel chain apart is the folks who work there. On the first night, a younger male employee gave us a rundown of the best burgers in Boston. Who doesn't love a great burger? The next night a female employee walked us through many wonderful Italian options on the North End.

The wine happy hour is a great way to kick off the evening - and they aren't stingy on the pours!

The hotel is very pet friendly. We were a little nervous because a happy pooch greated us everytime we got off the elevator (barking). However, as we moved to our room, the sound lessened - good sound proofing.

I was a little under the weather, and was shocked at the offering of "extras" for a guest's use during one's stay - including a humidifier. How thoughtful!

The rooms aren't huge, but are well-designed so you don't feel too closed in. The location was great - easy walk to Boston Commons, the North End, Freedom Trail, Beacon Hill (Don't miss Paramount for Breakfast).

Stayed here for a getaway weekend with some friends and was very pleased with the choice. The staff really are very friendly--they have a 'can do' attitude for most anything you ask for. The location is unbeatable. It is right on the Freedom Trail across from the Granary (a historic graveyard) and within walking distance to everything. You can take the T (subway) to it right from the airport. Beds are extremely comfortable and the room has a great, fully-stocked mini bar with reasonable prices for most items. The water pressure was so great it almost made me want to spend my vacation in the shower. Best hotel shower I've had.

My two suggestions would be: make sure you know what room you are booking. We booked a premium corner room that looked nothing like the picture online. They said it was the same class of room but it was one small window vs a wall of windows. In their defense, they did correct the problem and gave us the better room. Also, the coffee and tea were cold every morning we were there so I'd suggest the Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks right around the corner.

Overall, it is a very good hotel to choose if you are in Boston so see the sites and spend a fun weekend exploring.

Hobby of mine takes me to pro MLB baseball stadiums around the US. Fenway Park was next on my list and I figured I would want to visit other sites in Boston. Girly and I stayed in downtown for 3 nights with the intention of walking or using the T subway to get around. We had arrived at 6 am early from a red eye flight from the west coast so we were at a disadvantage of not knowing what to do. Our first impression of the hotel came from its attentive staff. The front desk was kind enough to advise that while our room would not be ready until after noon that they could hold our luggage until one became available. Without hesitation they provided a map of the city and recommended key locations that would keep us busy until they called us. Impressive! Hotel itself is nicely decorated geared for any mainstream visitor. The room is about 360 square feet, bathroom was in marble with glass shower. The TV was on the small side but not that it mattered. Since you are downtown you are not going to get the the best views, maybe the other end had views, not sure. We were on the 15th floor but on the north end. The lobby in the front is comfortable to watch the city walk by and is used to hold a wine happy hour daily. We unfortunately missed the happy hour but there was a good vibe when we walked by it. The location of the hotel has its advantages with access to Freedom Trail, 5-10 minute walk to North End (little Italy), Quincy Market (Faneuil Hall), Beacon Hill, Boston Common Park, and downtown. We missed out on eating at KO restaurant, atttached to hotel. Also missed out on catching a brew at Beantown Pub which is steps away. Overall we were more than impressed with the hotel staff and location. Enjoy!

The location cannot be beat in Boston. We walked everywhere easily! Steps from Government center, right near the common, and only 5 minutes to the North End. Also, with a T stop right there, everything is easy to get to.

We had an upgrade to a room with a view, which was great. You could see the entire common and beyond, as well as the river.

Room was clean, bed comfortable, bathroom great (love the bath products at Kimpton hotels), wine reception great.

My only complaint was the first night the group across the hall was slamming their door all night. We physically tried to close our door that loudly just to test how hard it was, and we could not do it as loudly as they were so I don't know what was up with that. Though that's nothing against the hotel, just the rude group that was staying there.

My sisters and I stayed at the Back Bay Hotel for 6 nights. We really enjoyed it. We were there very little during the day, but were usually in by 9ish at night and out the door by about 10 a.m. Housekeeping did a lovely job. We had everything that we needed. On a couple of rainy days when we were walking a lot, they gave us an extra umbrella to use. The door man was very conversational and even gave us a souvenir miniature police car, since the building used to be a police station. There was some construction across the street, but there was no disturbing noise from it. Great location for doing all the "touristy" things in Boston, and close to a couple of T stations. It was a great trip!

The Back Bay Hotel is a great place to stay. Each member of staff that we came into contact with were so kind & helpful. Nothing was a problem for them. The rooms are very good and the hotel itself is very interesting being the former home of The Boston Police Department. The location is perfect. Just a few minutes walk to the Public Gardens and Boston Common, Copley Square. A number of T Stops are close by, if you need to use them. Boston central is so easy to navigate by foot so you won't be needing the T too often (dependent on weather).

This is a truly great hotel and especially because of the wonderful staff.

The BBH is in a perfect location for the the centre of Boston, Fenway Park (walking distance) and the high end shops in Back Bay. There are building works still going on opposite but they didn't bother us. The room was a good size, clean, nice sized bathroom but it was a bit ragged around the edges and felt like it needed an upgrade soon. Overall the BBH is a solid, decent value 4* hotel and would have got the same rating here but.....WiFi was woefully slow, both in the room and the lobby. I see fast WiFi as standard these days - it was terrible. Either fix it, or don't pretend it works. We were here for leisure but it would be impossible for business.

Would I come to Boston again? Yes, in a heartbeat. Stay in BBH......? Probably not - bit too average.

I recently stayed here with my husband and 3-month old baby. The location was absolutely perfect. We valeted our car for $40/day with unlimited access to it. The hotel is in walking distance (and stroller-friendly) to several key spots: Dunkin' Donuts (major!), Shaw's supermarket, and the Prudential Center. Bring your own goodies to the room, since it comes with a decent-sized mini-fridge (with complementary water bottles). The room was great, and the bed was one of the most comfy beds I've ever slept in. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

The Back Bay Hotel is a five star hotel at a reasonable price. While not as high profile as some of the other local hotels, this is a wonderful spot with a terrific history (used to be the police headquaqrters). The did a great job transforming the building into a hotel including some very interesting design features. The rooms are comfortable and upscale. The common areas, while not opulent like the Copley Plaza, are very nice. They even make the valet parking work when they don't have much room and no attached parking facility. And, the location is phenominal; right in middle of back bay and walking distance to most everything. I would go back in a heabeat.

I rate the the hotel Very Good, adding that the location is excellent and central to lots of places to walk, eat and site see (Boyston & Newbury Streets, Boston Commons, Comm. Ave. all within walking distance).

Valet service was friendly and efficient. They seemed to like our Hertz Mustand GT!

Desk clerks Seth and John get a special mention as they both were very helpful in giving us directions and great day trip ideas. One morning I came downstairs to the lobby very early, before the coffee was out, and John gratiously went out of his way to get me a fresh cup that he made himself. Seth gave us great ideas for a trip to Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard. These 'extras' made an already nice trip even more special.

An area of improvement is in what I call 'mechanics.' We actually stayed in two different rooms and in both cases the in room coffee maker did not work. In the second room the exhaust fan in the bathroom wasn't working and I reported this to maintenance. It was awknowledged but nothing was done and we were in the second room 3 nights, and the first for 2 nights. I rate these issues as fairly 'minor' and not enough to seriously detract from an otherwise very nice stay. But management can and should correct these items.

Rating: 4 Stars and Highly Recommended

For the record, John and Seth carried the rating to four stars by both being above and beyond the norm for service, more than offsetting the two maintenance/mechanical issues noted above.

Hotel location is amazing. The pool is great. The room was ok. Our room had some minor damages that we noted upon arrival. I wouldn't think that the hotel would rent the room out though in the condition that it was in. There was a huge crack in the closet door. Looked like someone tried to punch it but it was big. There were also many scuff marks on the walls throughout. The bed was the bet part of the room, so cozy! We had a few hiccups with conceigere, and we let management know. Probably won't go back.

'A delightful experience'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 8, 2012

We chose this hotel for an overnight stay in Boston when location (proximity to dinner venue) was our priority. It seemed to offer better value for money than other similarly graded hotels in Boston (why are Boston hotels so expensive?) so we expected some hidden flaw but were very pleasantly surprised. The room was modern and attractive, very clean and they accommodated our request for as quiet a room as possible. Staff were cheerful, friendly and helpful and we are particularly grateful for the trouble they went to to return the Kindle we left in the room.

'Wow, you can't say that everyday about a hotel or service anymore!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 7, 2012

Excellent, excellent, excellent! In Boston for a trade show and what an unbelievable experience at this hotel. From the doormen, all the staff and beyond-they make sure everything is about you! It's like stepping back in time, to a kinder, gentler world that doesn't exist anymore. The rooms are beautiful, the views nice, location is fabulous. You can't go wrong.

I NEVER write reviews-but I had to! I highly recommend this hotel, don't even think twice. If your going to be in Boston, this is where to stay!!

My colleague and I stayed in the Colonnade while we attended the Joint Mathematics Meetings Conference. The staff were extremely friendly, helpful, and professional at all times!

At one point, our shower malfunctioned (it happens), and they sent someone up within minutes of our calling. Another time our remote ran out of batteries and again within minutes, the problem was fixed!

The concierge gave us great recommendations for grocery stores, bars, cocktails, and restaurants! No matter who was on duty, we were always greeted with a smile and a sense of humor! I'd go back any time!

'Good but perhaps 'unremarkable'.'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 2, 2012 via mobile

Stayed for 5 days in late May. We booked a luxury king room which was relatively expensive given other places we have stayed...the room was the unremarkable part. Breakfast in the brasserie was very good and the usual American service was overly polite however after being asked how I was that morning for the 3rd or 4th time the experience diminished! The roof top pool and seating area is first class. To lay back and relax with a drink looking at the high-rise tower blocks surrounding you was sureal. There is a gym on the 5th floor which is well equipped and quiet...all in all a good restaurant, ok gym, ok location and service, untemarkable room.Ok I guess is the word of the review.

'Great Location/Wonderful Staff/Modern Room'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 30, 2012

Booked thru travel agent, Freedom Tours...Excellent Choice...due to fact that I had 4 adults in one luxe double room it was a little crowded, but room is modern, clean, beds are comfortable, very nice stay, and most hotels in the area did not accept 4 adults in one room, so it was a great find! Staff were friendly and helpful and Bill Hagen (Asst. Mgr.) solved a parking issue when hotel was hosting a Bar Mitzvah and car park was full when we returned from being out all day, so he had us park in Manager's Parking Area for the night plus they refunded parking fee for one evening! Roof top pool, bar and lounge area is very nice... TIP: If you join I Prefer (free membership) then you get free internet access and other rewards depending on the hotel you stay at in the group.
Very nice hotel and pleasant stay...adding a complimentary continental breakfast would put this at Excellent!

'Quiet and perfect!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 30, 2012

My family of four (me, my husband and 2 teenage boys) stayed here for 3 nights when we were doing college tours in the area. Got a great room rate on the hotel's website (this hotel gives you the option of selecting a "quiet floor" when you book through their website...and, quiet it was!). No people noise, no doors slamming, no elevators cranking and beeping, no traffic noise...nothing! I slept so well on the comfortable king-sized bed.

The staff is amazing. As others have said, every employee of this hotel is friendly and helpful, yet they somehow manage to stay out of your way and and remain unobtrusive.

Shower pressure is amazing...like a massage! Rooms are configured in a way that makes them feel more spacious than a typical hotel room layout. Floor to ceiling windows make the space light and airy.

Location of the hotel couldn't be better...T station is right outside the front door. Rooftop pool is really nice, with an incredible view. There is also a Shaw's supermarket up the street, should you need anything.

We rented hubway bikes across the street from the hotel (check out this system; it's really a cool).

In short, this is a wonderful place to stay when visiting Boston. I'd stay here again and again.

'Wonderful stay!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 29, 2012

We stayed at the Colonnade May 23-27 for our daughter's graduation. After flying from the west coast on a red-eye, we asked for an early check-in and got one as soon as the housekeeping staff could clean a room for us, the hotel having been completely full the night before! We joined the IPrefer loyalty program (free!) a couple of months before our stay and got free wi-fi in our room. We were given a room facing the South End, and it was quiet enough that we could leave the windows open at night. The air conditioning was indeed noisy but kept the room nice and cool. Our room was a bit crowded for our family of 4 (Dad, Mom, adult daughter, teenage son) because we requested a roll-away in addtion to the two very comfortable double beds. The bathroom is small, but the shower has the best water pressure I've ever experienced!! We would have reused our bath towels if there had been a rack from which to hang them.

We loved the convenience of being right on the T - used it to get everywhere we didn't want to walk to. We walked to Fenway, MIT, and downtown easily from the hotel.
The staff was just wonderfully welcoming, especially Norman, the doorman, who has a gift for hospitality!

Our stay at the Colonnade was the centerpiece of a wonderful trip to Boston!

'Not sure if I'll return ...'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 9, 2012 NEW

My initial stay was in 2010 and was checking reviews to see if I would like to stay again. Not sure at this point.

Previous stays in Boston have been at the Fairmonts (Copley & Wharf), The Back Bay and The Liberty. St Botolph has a totally different vibe than the aforementioned and that's why I chose to stay there initially. Location is great. Familiar with Boston so I didn't need someone available to answer questions.

Booked directly with the inn. No problem with the access code. Appreciated the privacy and the coffee offerings, etc.

Stayed in the 1 bedroom and it was comfortable and beautifully decorated ... but not maintained. It was a shame. Towel bar hanging from the wall, chipped paint and furniture was looking a bit worn. Preferred not to go barefoot.

That was two years ago. I recall wondering if the location and design would sustain The Inn at St Botolph because it didn't appear that the rooms were regularly inspected for cleanliness and maintenance issues. They could do better.

I suspect business is good enough and they'll coast along.

We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay! Our two bedroom executive suite is very popular as the master bedroom features a King size bed, and the second bedroom has the twin size trundle bed. Both bedrooms, as well as the oversized living room, have 42'' flat screen televisions too!

If you want to stay at a place where the furniture and fixtures are frayed and dirty, the staff surly and the access inscrutable, I highly recommend St Botolph's; if not, flee. I booked St B's because it was convenient to my meetings and had excellent ratings on TripAdvisor. When I arrived there was a locked door with an enigmatic access system that you get to figure out while you are waiting in an uncovered area (it was pouring the day we arrived.) We finally gave up and rang the door bell, only to be greeted by a surly young voice demanding our access code. He was appalled that we did not have one but reluctantly admitted us. They email it to you, unless of course you book through a third party such as as Orbitz, as we did. There is no access (or management presence on the property) after 10pm except by code, so don't be late!

We were assigned a "ground" floor room. And by ground floor, I mean 8 feet underground with a slit of light at the top. Objecting to paying $350 for such a room, we were met with disbelief and more surliness and the comment that we had only paid $250 (It was $369 to be exact.)

We got a better room, which looks nice in pictures but the way-too-cool furniture and fixtures are dented, chipped, banged up and, in one case, hanging precariously from the wall. Our shower area was dirty and the obviously short maid only cleaned the glass as high as she could reach leaving about 2 feet of dirty glass.

The building is noisy and largely uninsulated as you can hear every door open and every conversation on the street when the windows are closed.

Our clock was set 40 minutes behind the actual time, The thermostat had a low battery and didn't function properly. And of course there is no one to call at 11 pm when you discover this.

This frumpy B&B without the delightful owners to make up for its frumpiness is really unworthy of the praise it gets.

The droopy orchid that greets you as you enter (see photo) says it all. as does the notice in the room that says you will not get maid service unless you ask for it.

June 4, 2012
Dear Valued Guest,

First, allow me to thank you for choosing the Inn @ St. Botolph!

I apologize that you found your stay to be less than satisfactory. The staff at the Inn @ St. Botolph takes great pride in offering outstanding customer service. We realize our hotel is not typical and we work very hard to ensure that guests realize this before making a reservation. Unfortunately, when booking through third party websites our message is not always translated clearly.

The Inn at St Botolph integrated state-of-the-art technology when we first opened our doors in 2008. I can certainly sympathize with you and understand how some features of the hotel may have been different than what you were expecting. However, most of our guests choose to stay with us for those very same features. Some examples of our uniqueness are the keyless entry locks on the front door and unit doors, color video intercom system, free wireless and plug-in internet, i-home integration, unlimited telephone calls within the continental united states and Canada, 42' satellite TV complete with complimentary movie channels not to mention in-room features like a full size refrigerator with ice maker and kitchenette complete with wine and champagne glasses, luxury bedding plus so much more

The process of making a reservation with our hotel is also different. Most of our guests make an online reservation through our website. Payment is processed at the time of reservation and a confirmation is immediately returned via email. Two weeks prior to your arrival date guests receive an email providing them with a room assignment and entry code that will work to the front door and their room. This code is unique and only works from 3pm on the arrival day to 11am on the departure date. Upon arrival guests simply enter their code and voila - they have access to the hotel, their room and the gym. Our front desk is not located at the entry point but instead is situated on the ground level along with the business center, lounge and gym. Guests enjoy extreme privacy while they reside with us, but our staff is always available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, willing to provide as much or as little support as needed.

All of the rooms at The Inn at St Botolph have a Southern exposure. The one bedroom ground suite has full size windows, is partially below grade and by nature receives the least sunlight of any of our suites. For this reason, this over-sized one bedroom is priced less than similar room types at The Inn. Let me assure you that because this room is so aggressively priced, is frequently reserved by third party sites and is the only guest room on the ground level, we are extremely careful that we clearly outline our room description. When making an online reservation we encourage guests to read the room description and visit the hotels website for specific information about the features of the establishment. Even intimate boutique hotels like ours have several different room types. Although each has a unique nature, not every room or every hotel is perfect for every guest.

Please be assured that we take positive and negative guest reviews very seriously. Based on your criticisms, we are in the process of re-evaluating the reservation process with third party vendors and are re-invigorating our team to better address details and handle stressful situations. I can assure you that your stay and experience is an anomaly for us.
We would be honored if you would allow us to host you on your next visit to Boston with our compliments. Please let me personally re-introduce you to our quaint little hotel.

My Sincerest Apologies,

A truly pleasant experience. The place is remarkably modern. It is noticeable that attention was given to the smallest details. The rooms are spacious, and very clean. The hotel staff is friendly. Best location in Boston, located just between the trendy South End neighborhood and the lively and commercial Back Bay. My husband and I lived in Boston for three years and the hotel's quality, atmosphere, and location enabled us to enjoy the best of what Boston has to offer.

'Great concept, top location - bring earplugs!'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 20, 2012

Pros
- excellent location, on the border of South End (cosy restaurants, pleasant streets) and Back Bay (shops, restaurants, bars) so its an easy walk into Down Town (but out of the tourist zone like the big hotels are in), plus it has a subway station 5 min walk away so its 45mins from picking up your bags at the airport to being in your room.
- key system, great too as you can't lose your keys, it doesn't matter when you check in and presumably you save money as less staff
- decent light breakfast
- very comfy bed
- ipod dock a great idea
- lots of space - had a bedroom, hall, living space and bathroom
- windows are pretty soundproof
- rooms 201, 101, 301 and 401 have the bay window

CONS
- don't pick a room next to the lift shaft (I think that is room 100, 202, 302) as your bedroom wall (thin partition) is adjacent to the elevator shaft and very noisy - we asked to move rooms NB staff helped us do this
- there is little soundproofing between floors so you can hear every footstep above you and I could hear our neighbor on the telephone in the bedroom next door until after midnight
- I agree some fixtures and paintwork could do with some TLC
- on arrival (after the 3pm check in time) we let ourselves into the room and found it hadn't been cleaned at all which was very annoying after travelling from the UK but the staff did sort it out fairly quickly

i stayed at the inn at st botolph last week with my mother. I have nothing but good things to say about the customer service i received as well as the overwhelming ambience of the place itself. with the hotel's code lock system i felt safe to come and go as i pleased while the hotel itself is only a 3 minute walk from the station. The staff there were so friendly as i spent most of my days by myself, they told me where to go and what to see (as well as what not to see) i was especially impressed with the receptionist called "dante" who drew on my map ALL the places to see, as well as how to get there. The breakfast and gym were immaculate and the coffee was superb!

This hotel was referred to me by a friend prior to a West Coast trip, when I had an early morning flight. Instead of taking an early morning bus from north of Boston to Logan at 3:00am, I decided to stay in the city to make sure I had a hassle-free experienceand a night out on the town. I stayed only one night, but want to move in! I had a very restful night's sleep in a VERY comfortable bed/linens.

This place is just a block away from the Prudential Center, yet I felt like it was in the heart of the South End. Also at 4am I was able to catch a cab right away on Huntington(I think the cabs line up for the Colonade Hotel... score!). Luckily I saw that the T doesnt run that early, if it was a later flight I couldve saved $20 and just paid a few bucks for the T, as there is a stop right at the Prudential.

The minimal interaction I had with the staff was warm, and I think its great that you dont have to have awkward give-and-take with a front desk person when you come and go. The office is on the lower level and next to the lounge/ breakfast room, and I had a good "shoot the breeze" chat with Tom the manager.

Overall, a great start to my trip and a great experience.

Before I start, you should know two things:

1. I live in Boston
2. I stayed here twice within a month

Okay, so now that I got this out of the way, you got a gist of what I'm going to say about this place; LOVE IT. I had the pleasure to stay at this wonderful property with my special guy for some personal time away from home. Our first stay was in a fourth floor unit that was spaciously cozy and the design was not overly stylish, but had an artful and simple charm- a dream studio apartment. It was truly a home away from home as it is nestled amongst the brownstones in the Back Bay/South End area. If I could afford to live here, this is exactly what it would feel like. The hotel staff were practically invisible (but always a phone call away- if you needed them) which made you feel like a true resident. Being centrally located between the high-end Prudential Center area and the urban-chic South End neighborhood, the options for restaurants and venues are endless. Easy for catching cabs, commuting or just strolling. There is a 7-Eleven across the street if you need to grab some snacks, beverages and ingredients, should you decide to make a meal in the privacy of the fully-loaded kitchenette in your room.

For our second stay we were given a room on the first floor, right by the front entrance, which we were not happy about at first (naturally we thought we would lose the nice view and gain the noise of traffic coming in/out the door) but when we entered the room it was as though we entered a sanctuary. The room layout was cleverly designed to accentuate the windows and we found that the views were actually better here. As for any outside noise...what noise? We didn't hear a thing! We made the most of kitchenette and stored our left over dinner in the fridge and cooked a delightful breakfast in the morning. I cannot forget to mention that the beds here are one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in!

Cons:
1. Parking - they don't have parking for the property and the closest one is at the Prudential Center which can be expensive. But they soften the blow a bit with a discount coupon available at the office (for $27.00 for overnight).

2. Standing Showers - I am not sure if this is true for all units, but the two we stayed in only had showers. I like the option to take a bath (especially when I am away from home and have the time to do so). But its not a major issue being that the bathrooms are nicely designed.

The Technicalities:

They have satellite cable with a lot of channels, which is great. However, you can't order any movies although the ads make it very tempting.

They have an iPod dock, which is great for providing your own music...but it only works with iPods (not iPhones).

Wi-fi was great..strong signals throughout!

If you're like me and like to experience hotels/inns as a way of feeling at home or as a local, than The Inn at St. Botolph will satisfy your needs. I would definitely stay here again...and again.

My party traveled to Boston the last week of March 2012. We rented all three rooms on the 4th floor (the 2 bedroom, the 1 bedroom and the studio), so we had the entire 4th floor. Everything about our visit was perfect. The rooms were decorated very nicely with high end furnishings. Access was very easy with the keypad entry system. Beds were comfortable. Place was spotless. Rooms were quiet. I don't think we even saw another guest the whole time we were there. I cannot say enough about the location. The neighborhood is the best with public transportation just around the corner. I have already recommended this place to several people who will be visiting Boston. I am from Chicago and have been in lots of places. This one ranks right up there. You will NOT be disappointed. Anyone who has a complaint about this place simply cannot be pleased anywhere. Strongly recommend the Inn at St. botolph.

'Best in Boston'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 6, 2012

If you are headed to Boston for business or leisure, there really is no comparison to Mandarin. Location on Boylston street is ideal, connected to Copley center for best Boston shopping. Restaurants and bars are literally across the street, Fenway park is 10 minutes away. The rooms are the most spacious and luxurious. Over sized bathrooms, with mirrors in the shower, ideal for shaving. Hotel is most expensive in Boston, but clearly is the best in town.

'Top Notch Hospitality'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 19, 2012

My daughter, son-in-law, and 8 month old grandson stayed at The Mandarin and I got the opportunity to see it first hand (and, anew, after a disasterious first time bar visit over a year ago - horrible mixed drinks). I viewed their room (plush, expansive, and positive in every respect). Their comment: was this: "hands down", the best in Boston (and they are here quarterly on business/pleasure). I agree!

I visited them and found the staff to be fantastic in every respect. I saw how efficient the Staff was and how caring and considerate they were toward my grandson (not fawning, just genuinely interesting in his enjoyment).

They will definitely stay there again and it is my pleasure / duty to report that I hope to visit with them there as well.

'Luxury and serenity'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed April 2, 2012

I stayed in a deluxe king bed room on the Extra Day Away - One Free Night offer in mid- February. After a thorough search through tripadvisor, i chose the Mandarin for its luxury, comfort, and location.

Rooms are clean and comfortable and the bathrooms are marble and lovely. There is a large shower, bath tub, and separate WC area.

Room service is available 24hours and the food is delicious. Staff are very helpful (had some issues with the telephone , which were quickly resolved) and cordial.

The spa is fantastic and can cater to your needs. I asked for a leg - centere massage, which was heavenly.

The hotel's proximity to stores, parks, and the downtown area is ideal. A bit on the expensive side for Boston, but can be worth it

'A Pleasure From A-Z'

My recent short stay at this property was a pleasure from A-Z  made special by the staff; their warm, professional welcomes and ease of communication without being stilted. Next time I look forward to enjoying the property for a longer visit, whilst making time for the amazing looking spa! Top-notch Boston stay  doesn't get better from what I can tell in this town, with its wonderful location that is multi-purpose from fun to biz to academia interests.

Also, Asana's chef's table is absolutely the perfect private table in Boston (at a hotel that is!) - peer onto the kitchen to see the action.

this hotel is pretty good, albeit ferociously pricey...my beef with it is that a) noone helped with my bags b) breakfast was included in the price but when I checked in, the lady at reception said it wasnt, so it was only when my PA told me it was a b+b deal that i had breakfast (ie once out of six days), and no offer of credit was made to me on checkout, despite their error. Its well situated, staff are generally friendly, rooms are clean although smallish, but as i said, this is very expensive for what it is- and its no Mandarin Oriental HK!

'A Jewel'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed March 16, 2012

This is really one of the best hotels in the world but one would expect no less from the Mandarin chain. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, the staff attentive but not obsequious and the atmosphere charming. The bar is vibrant but can get very crowded and busy. My only criticism was the breakfast. There is no buffet so, if you want a cooked breakfast you have to order from the menu which offers you considerably less choice.

'GREAT HOTEL, NEAR BACK BAY, WALK TO NEWBURY ST.'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 12, 2012 NEW

I first heard about the Courtyard Marriott from a google search. The pricing wasnt all that ridiculous compared to other hotels in the area. My daughter attends Northeastern University, and you could walk from here. I've been staying there for the last four years. The staff is fantastic, especially Justin McToal. Anytime I needed a new reservation, or needed anything special while there, he was right there to accomodate me. I have never seen such a clean place! The ladies room in the lobby was so sparkling clean that you could literally eat off the floor. Everything was shiny clean! There's not a whole lot of frills but who cares, you are literally 1 1/2 blocks to Newbury St., a few steps from Prudential Center, Boston Duck Tours, and across the street from Lord and Taylor. I highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in Back Bay.

I travel to Boston frequently and I would never stay anywhere else than the Courtyard Copley Sqare. The staff from Bernardo the GM to those at the front desk to the valet are all focused on excellence and customer service! The property is conveniently located near everything whether you want to take a walk down Newberry Street, head to Fenway, eat at some of the best resturants or get to any of the many attractions in Boston. The hotel feels like a family owned hotel as there are less than 90 rooms. I highly recommend this hotel and staff to all!

I was searching for a hotel in the Back Bay that wasn't absolutely outrageous in price. I never quite found that hotel... but this was the closest. I'm a Marriott family fan. The location can't be beat. The building is historic, so the rooms are odd shapes, but they are well appointed. I had desk, chair, mini-fridge, and granite bathroom. Wireless was included with the rate.

While there's no full service concierge, they assisted me in getting a towncar to the airport, with restaurants, and with directions. I would book again.

'Marriott Boston great choice for haynes conf. center'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 4, 2012

I wanted to write this review b/c I was torn between the Sheraton as it was closer to the convention center and the Marriott. I ended up having to split time at both due to the rates that week.

I thought the Marriott was going to be further away from the convention center, however it was not that much further. it was a nice walk thru a mall and you didn't have to go outside.
I actually enjoyed the 7 minute walk.
My first half was at the Marriott and while the Sheraton was closer to the convention center, the Marriott was so much nicer. I have to note though that I was in the older South tower at the Sheraton and those rooms haven't been updated yet, the North tower at the Sheraton has, so maybe it would be on par with the Marriott, but loved my Marriott room. All newly rennovated.

I can highly recommend this hotel.

I'm usually loyal to Hilton family properties but ventured out of my comfort zone to stay at the Courtyard Marriott in Copley Sq Boston - and what a great property - great value for money, they have a Sam Adam promotion where you get 6 beers, bucket, beer openers, 2 glasses and buffet breakfast for two for $35 on top of your rate. Rooms were great, love the Paul Mitchell toiletries - great quality! Room was very comfortable, has a solid gym and great location. Friendly and very helpful staff. Valet parking is $45/night or $30-35 self parking across the road.

The Courtyard at Copley square is an old but well kept up building and very clean. It is in a nice central location close to touristy things. The hotel staff were all very pleasant and willing to help two older tourists navigate the many interesting sites in Boston. There is no swimming pool and no real restuarant though they do serve breakfast and are open for a couple of hours in the evening for a simple meal. Our room was clean - the bed comfortable and in general nicely set up. The high speed internet service worked well.

The Courtyard Copley Square is a great central Boston hotel. As Courtyards go - it is not the typical cookie cutter style. The rooms are large and nicely appointed, some with bay windows that open to let in the fresh air. The staff is wonderful - anticipating your needs before you do. Within walking distance of great shopping and restaurants and a short 15 minute cab ride from Logan. When you're leaving, be sure to ask the staff to book you a car service. The company they use is excellent, friendly, on-time and the same price as a cab.

We stayed on points for 5 nights and found the hotel to be very well located for visiting Boston's numerous sights. We asked for a quiet room on reservation and had a room off the road on a relatively high floor which was quiet. The rooms are fairly small but well appointed, with free Wi-Fi. Front desk staff were very friendly and gave us lists of places to eat for dinner. We did not have breakfast so cannot comment on that. Lifts worked well and were very quick. I would recommend to people wanting a clean, central, quiet and reasonably economic stay in Boston.

Stayed here May 11 - 13 while in Boston for two Red Sox games. I dont live far from Boston but prefer to just spend the night when going to games. Used Marriott points one night and got a great deal the second night. This hotel is a perfect location. Walked to Fenway one night in about 15 minutes. Took a cab the other night and it took about 15 minutes and costed $10. Also there is a T stop near by. We were upgraded to the 2 room suite which is a lot of space especially for a Boston Hotel. Only downside was parking...$45 a night for valet but it is Boston however even this a little high it seems. Would stay here again however would take T into Boston or find a cheaper place to park

Having just returned from a three night stay at The Seaport Boston Hotel, my wife and I can't wait to go back. The hotel is located in the harbour area and we had a beautiful room on the 8th floor overlooking the harbour. The room was very spacious with some really nice touches. They have a 'Pillow Library' where you can choose from a variety of pillows. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. As I was in Boston on business I found the hotels business centre of great use. Don't be put off by the fact the hotel doesn't have it's own parking. You can still avail of the valet parking which is charged at a daily rate. All gratuities are included in your room price so the staff won't accept any further tips.
The area has many bars and restaurants from Dunkin' Donuts across the road to the Legal Seafood Harbourside Restaurant and The Whiskey Priest Bar. The hotels Tamo bar is really relaxing and we had a light snack on one evening which was delicious.
The walk from the hotel to the city center takes in some wonderful views from the busy harbour area to the impressive skyline of the city. Having stayed in the Back Bay area on our last visit, we will hopefully be returning and will definitely be recommending The Seaport Boston Hotel.

'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 12, 2012 NEW

This is a business travelers review of this property, so take it in that context.

Let me start by saying, I love Boston. The city has tremendous charm, excellent restaurants, a multitude of cultural and social attractions and a very rich history. It also has a plethora of fine hotels. This, honestly, isn't one of them.

First, the good:

*The hotel is clean
*It is located near the financial district (approx 10 minute walk, or 2 minute cab ride)
*The service was excellent
*There are multiple on site facilities including full health club, spa, restaurant, snack shop, bar and valet.
*It is easily accessible form Logan airport via public transit.
*Non smoking and pure air facility. I stayed on a "pet-free" floor.
*Nice lobby, plenty of seating and meeting spaces.
*There is free wifi throughout the property. It was quick and had a strong signal.
*This is a "service inclusive" hotel. Staff will not accept tips. Really. I tried!


Now, the not so good:

*The room was sparsely furnished. I didn't find it comfortable or inviting.
*My room, right next to the elevator, was SO noisy. I heard the elevators whipping up and down, all night. Have they not heard of sound proofing?
*The bed, while large, was saggy.
*They charge an exorbitant amount for overnight parking $42
*Not centrally located.
*There isn't much in the immeadiate area, so be prepared to walk long ways, or cab it to different areas within the city.
* The surrounding area has a very industrial feel

The bottom line:

Given the vast choice of places to stay in Boston, I would only stay here if you are (a) travelling on a budget, (b) get an incredible rate (I paid $247 a night), (c) or are attending an event at the nearby convention center. Otherwise, I suggest you seek other accommodations.

This is a hotel that, like the little car that could, really wants to be a good hotel, and does try, but ultimately comes up short versus the competition.

5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 12, 2012 NEW

Having travelled all over the world and stayed at many 5 star properties, I have to say this hotel ranks amongst some of the best. What sets this hotel apart from many others is its CUSTOMER SERVICE! It is top-notch.

The hotel is located on the waterfront, across the harbour from Logan Airport. Best way to get to the hotel from the airport is by public transit - Silver Line - SL1 - picks up at every terminal at Logan and takes you to the hotel in 10-15min for $2!!! Get off at the World Trade Center station and the hotel is right across the street from the station, a short 2 min walk. Why pay $30 for a taxi and spend 30-40 min in traffic to do the same thing? Public transit in Boston is the way to get around and this hotel is located right on the Silver Line. The hotel provides a beautiful view of the harbour and has many great restaurants within walking distance. It is also a short walk across a bridge from the Boston Convention Center. Can't ask for a better location. To get to great shopping ob Newbury St, simply take the Silver Line again and with 2 transfers and 20 min later, you're there. No need to spend $30 for a taxi.

The hotel has an all inclusive pricing policy. $3 per day is added to your hotel bill for "tipping", so there is NO tipping allowed outside of that. What a great idea! No more feeling obligated to tip or fumbling for change. The staff is very friendly and extremely helpful. From the bell staff to front desk, to concierge, housekeeping, in-room dining, banquet staff etc., every single staff I encountered was friendly, helpful, efficient. I have no complaints!

Check in was quick and easy. My room was on the 11th floor and I could see the harbour from my window. Room was very large with a good sized bathroom. Well furnished and very functional. Although you could tell the furniture is getting old, it did not have a run down feeling. Everything was clean and neat. There was a mirror and small ledge in the hallway for you to put keys etc on. A built in luggage rack with drawers below provided ample storage space. Large work desk with high speed internet connection for the business traveller. Free high speed internet is available throughout the entire property - fantastic! Business centre provides computers if you didn't bring your own. What's great was that they also provide free printing service. You can print anything right from your own laptop in your room and retrieve it from their printer in the Business Center - 24/7!

In room Keurig coffee maker, mini-fridge, iron, ironing board, umbrella and even a UPS envelope! In room safe also available. Very comfortable bed with a nice duvet and a "pillow library" with 10 different kinds of pillows for you to choose from. You will get a good night sleep here! The only complaint I have with my room was that it was close to the elevator and you could hear people talk, esp. at night when everything else was quiet.

The bathroom was a good size and had Gilchrist and Soames toiletries. The hotel is very "green" - everywhere you turn, you see evidence of them trying to conserve and leave a smaller carbon footprint. Good recycling program in room and throughout hotel.

In room dining was excellent. Food was delivered on time as promised. My Cosmo and white wine were always ice cold and the food was always hot. Surprisingly reasonably priced and extremely tasty! I did not expect the food from room service to be as good as it was - very impressed.

The workout area is quite large and full of state of the art cardio equipment. My only complaint here is that it closes at 9pm on week nights and 8pm on weekends. Too early for my liking. Did not use the pool or the spa, so can't comment.

Conference facility was good, as was the catering for the meeting. Beautiful herb and flower garden outside, which you should take the time to enjoy.

Booked this hotel because it was the venue for a conference I was attending and speaking at. At every turn, we were impressed with this property and its operation. Late check-in, multiple bags brought to room with us by front desk clerk, unloaded and tip refused -- there is a no-tipping policy. We had a corner suite on the waterfront, and only the absence of a separate shower stall gave any downgrade to the room. Staff was attentive. The concierge, Betty Salemme (one of Boston's best), worked magic, made helpful suggestions for dining "with Bostonians", arranged transportation. Great meeting facilities, too. Rooms have free wireless access, and ability to print to a central color printer. A very "with it" place, comfortable and friendly. A redeveloped area, with many amenities.

'Seaport Hotel, Boston'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 9, 2012 NEW

Dear Fellow travelers and road warriors,

If you're looking for a BEAUTIFUL hotel to stay at in the Seaport district of Boston, this is definitely one of the best places to stay! Reasonably priced compared to other hotels in the areas, this hotel has so much more to offer, like an extravagant breakfast buffet, polite and professional staff - and a great set of quiet, clean rooms with plenty of space to stretch out, work and relax. There's a convenient Starbucks in the main lobby and the restaurant (AURA) is top notch! I'd stay here again in a heartbeat! Way to go, Seaport! A++ all the way!!!

'Good though pricey'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 9, 2012 NEW

I stayed in the Seaport Boston for a local trade exhibition - had a corner room with a view back over the conference and exhibition center, no view of the harbor which would be preferable.

This is a hotel that gets many things right - clean, comfortable, quiet. The room was of a reasonable size, the desk was adequate with a good number of power sockets, there is a Keurig coffee maker, room safe, free wi-fi. Bed is comfortable. Water provided was $2 for a small bottle and $4 for a slightly larger 'branded' bottle. The air-conditioning thermostat seemed somewhat unreliable. Breakfast is adequate with a buffet or a-la-carte choices. But it is not luxury, the entrance, foyer, facilities, style, the colors, quality of furniture and fittings were all pleasant but not striking, the area is ok, overall it was good as a business hotel. So no complaints but the price seemed at the high end for what you get.

One thing that I hadn't seen before for a US hotel is the policy that tips are included, something they remind you of at check-in and every time you settle a check. It doesn't mean they are included in the prices, it means they add them to the check and there does not appear to be any discretionary aspect to this.

As for the area from what I could see there was very little in the immediate vicinity. The hotel is close to the conference and exhibition center. There is a Morton's steak house across the road and the Legal Seafood restaurant a short walk away as well as a few other bars and restaurants. Otherwise the sites and activity is a longer walk or taxi ride away.

Overall I liked staying here and it definitely met the needs of my visit which was business. If I was a tourist I would probably choose a different location.

We stayed on the 6th floor. The room was nicely appointed. We enjoyed the use of the laundry facilities. Our stay was short but it was lovely. We used the valet and were quite happy with having the car so close. We will definitely be back.

'There IS Poetry Here!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 24, 2012

Visited here mid-May for a poetry writing retreat. The inn's motto is "There is poetry here!" and I certainly agree. This is a lovely old inn, welcoming and accommodating hosts, comfortable rooms and a great library including many poetry volumes. Each morning we were greeted by an excellent breakfast, a strata or French Toast, fresh baked muffins or banana bread, whole grain breads, cereal, granola, yogurt, fresh fruit. And excellent coffee. And every morning we were entertained by a theatre of birds outside the window. Woodpeckers, cardinals, even a flock of wild turkeys passing by. The inn is immaculate, rooms are made up promptly and well-stocked with toiletries. There were quiet places for reading, a lovely porch and grounds to enjoy. The azaleas were in bloom and delightful. There was plenty of travel info on Lenox and the Birkshires, Tanglewood, The Mount etc. Both Linda and Phil were always helpful in finding a good place for dinner or even a good mechanic (one of our group had some car problems)
This is a place where you feel very much at home, as if you were visiting old friends. I didn't even have the usual "first night in a new bed can't sleep" thing. I slept well, woke refreshed and ready to go every morning.
Wonderful!

We arrived between snow storms last January for my husand to give a speech and it was magical every minute in this beautiful house. Phil and Linda are the model hosts, the ones that you imagine every time you book a B&B..... but rarely find. Breakfasts were expansive with delicious homemade specialties (ask for Phil's baked French Toast!). You might all find a surprise drop of Sherry waiting on the mantelpiece of your real, working fireplace that is set and ready to light or cookies and coffee in the afternoon with hundreds of books to choose from for a good read. The bathrooms, beds, linens, towels, etc,were luxurious and each room a gem (we peeked at all of them!). Look carefully at their excellent website because every room varies in size and configuration but all have the same quality of amenities...not a bad room in the house. I even suggest calling and talking to Linda or Phil about your needs and they can help you choose the best room for you. This extordinary fully restored mansion is run as an annex to Heaven! Pure Bliss! Last but not least, the level of cleanliness is remarkable, BRAVO! to the staff.

This weekend was excactly what we were hoping for. It felt like we had entered a charmed zone outside common reality, where all was right with the world. Our stay was completely comfortable, the surroundings beautiful and the service and care by Linda and Phil truly gracious and warm.
We visited the great Mass Moca museum in North Adams and saw a charming Moliere play at the Shakespeare Theater. On our way home on Sunday we stopped by the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, which was really worth while. The full breakfasts were memorable - especially the luscious Grand Marnier french toast.
Thanks for a great weekend in a beautiful Inn. We hope to come back again.

'Lovely inn, excellent hospitality'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed February 20, 2012

We spent a winter weekend at the Brook Farm Inn and enjoyed it very much. Linda and Phil are great hosts. The common areas of the inn are great--the dining room and the sitting/living area which has window seats and a fireplace. Linda makes scones and they serve tea at 4 on weekends. This past weekend, she also told stories during that time (she's a professional story teller). It was very cool. The location of the in is fantastic--within walking distance to Lenox center and minutes away from Tanglewood (it's appears to be even walkable). The hosts are on the premises and extremely helpful. The rooms were nice--our room had a fireplace and clawfoot bathtub. You have to walk down the stairs to use the bathroom which at first bothered me but then I ended up kind of liking the fact that the bathroom was separate from the room itself. It also struck me initially as not as luxurious as I was expecting given the price of the room, but that feeling also went away after a few days. It is quite luxurious in its own quaint New England, old inn sort of way. Overall it was a great stay.

This was an experience of poetry and grace. It is difficult to find the perfect Inn but in Brook Farm we did just that. Phil and Linda were gracious and helpful, but truly just a pleasure to talk with. We stayed in the poet's room and felt comfortable without ostentation, elegant without feeling we were in a museum. We felt at home and as literary people were most thrilled with the poetry theme. I visit the area every summer and often stay in different inns. From now on I will always visit Brook Farm first.

Thank you to this guest, and all the others who take the time to write kind remarks. We're always delighted and gratified that our hospitality and breakfasts are enjoyed and appreciated. Just want to take this opportunity to note that our 15 rooms vary greatly in size. There are smaller, third floor rooms, large canopy bedrooms with wood-burning fireplaces on the first and second floors, and enormous rooms in the carriage house with jacuzzi tubs and other amenities. All guests, regardless of the room they select, can enjoy the large sitting room and library, both with fireplaces, and our ample breakfast buffet.

My wife and I really enjoyed our stay but there are some things we learned that may be helpful to other travelers. First, our hosts Phil and Linda were wonderful, and would do anything for us. Secondly, the place was clean and charming. It's close to down town Lenox, and we found plenty to do in the area. What might be helpful is to know that the stairs to the third floor are exceptionally steep, which was no big deal for us but for older travelers might be tough so avoid the third floor. We stayed in the Cozy Hideaway room. It was cozy and the website pictures are accurate, but be aware that with two people in the bed, one person will have a challenge to get out of bed without climbing over the other person. Again, this was no problem for us but may be for others. The room was small, but adequate and the bathroom was roomy. The only other thing to note is that I had a different idea about what a buffet breakfast was. It was served buffet style, but there was only one hot item and I found it to be average. Overall though it was a great experience and I would come back and I would also recommend Brook Farm to friends.

The Ames is centrally located to many of Boston's attractions. The decor is contemporary and Clean. Light sleepers may have some challenges here. Planes, trains, and buses are part of the typical noise flow despite the sound insulated windows. Ear plugs are complimentary in the night stand. They hotel was careless in placing us next to a family with an infant and toddler who woke us at 6:30AM wth screaming, playing and crying, in addition to shaking the adorments on the wall. It makes a good couples location but the Glass Showers may not permit the privacy wanted for families as a retractable currtain in the bedroom is the only coverage. The restaurant leaves only room for improvement. The service was very sophomore at best. Innattentiveness and hanging around with their collegues seems to be the status quo on both of our visits their. The food was atrocious. My desert resembled more of a burnt hockey puck with a overly heavy and rich chocolate pudding. Boston offers so many more great food options and service than this establishment can offer even if convienence is a factor. The front desk failed to adequately address our grievances over the disruptions. While checking out, another patron also expressed dissatisfaction over the noise and service levels. The supervisor kindly told me that they only had ten rooms available that night. When asked as to why they would place a family next to vacationing couples, I was met with a stupor and an offer of an upgrade to suite should I gamble with their Establishment again. The issues are much less of the hotel and location, city life is what it is, as it is more about the staff and their customer service.

'My favorite Boston hideaway and the BEST restaurant!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 5, 2012

Honestly, this is a FABULOUS boutique property. Chic, modern, upscale boutique with great service and probably the best room product in the city aside from the top 5-stars.

Pros:
Rooms- get a room that faces Court Street with the curved/rounded windows. We were upgraded into a suite and the room was stunning with fabulous street views (I've also stayed in a more standard level room which is equally nice and spacious). I love the furnishing, light colored hardwood floors, great bathrooms with my favorite bath products (Malin & Goetz).

Restaurant- Woodward is incredible. Their skillet/hash breakfasts are to die for (get the Lobster one). The dinner appetizer- short rib tortellini- is hands down one of my favorite culinary creations of all time...I think we ended up having 3 orders. The vibe is fun- a little younger, with a great upstairs bar and dance section.

Cons:
Although central, it's not my favorite part of the city- it's very financial district(ish) but a great central point to start from to walk to all the main sites. It's also pretty close from the train station so a short taxi trip.

'Disappointing stay at the Ames - A Morgans Orignal'
1 of 5 stars Reviewed June 2, 2012

Just returned from a stay at the Ames - A Morgans Original Hotel on June 2, 2012. Very Disappointing. Even though the hotel had several available rooms they decided to place us next to a familly with two small children (crying all night, very noisy). Not the families fault but the hotel should have made use of the rooms that were not occupied. In addition, finally we got to sleep and then the houskeeping service knocked on our door about 10:30 a.m. We had a privacy note on the door but still was woken up. Upon checkou,t spoke to the manager and she told us since we booked through a 3rd party there was nothing she could do. Would not stay at the hotel again. Also, the restaurant at the hotel was disappointing as well. Hopefully this review helps.

I'll start with the good stuff: This hotel is in a perfect location. It's basically on the Freedom Trail and near several of Boston's best sites. The rooms were spacious with modern and simple furniture. The amenities in the bathrooms were very nice as well. The free breakfast, while minimal, was a plus. The staff was friendly and helpful.

The bad: I have never been in a hotel with this much street noise. I was there from a Saturday to Tuesday and every single night there were police cars and sirens going off basically once an hour if not more. There were also other loud cars and a ton of motorcycles driving by at all hours of the night. What's worse is that this hotel is located right next to the Veterans Homeless Shelter so there were men sitting outside and across the street arguing loudly at 11 p.m.. We were in a room on the 6th floor overlooking Court St. but it was certainly not high enough to shield any of the noise. I went to sleep every night with a pillow over my head. Luckily, the hotel offered sleeping pills on the mini bar and I went ahead and purchased those so I could at least get a few peaceful hours. The hotel warned us of construction noise and I found out on the last day that there were ear plugs in the drawer of the night stand. Wish I had seen those just a few days sooner.

All and all, I liked the hotel but I wish I was in a different and quieter room.

I was lucky enough to stay at the Ames in Boston over the May 19th weekend. It is in an amazing area, minutes from many landmarks, restaurants and shops. The service was excellent, rooms spacious and they were very generous with their towels.

We had arrived pretty early in the morning and understandingly, our rooms were not ready. They stored our luggage for us, showed us the way to the nearest subway stop and off we were. We made it back at about 4pm and our rooms were ready. Luggage and bathrobes were sent up quickly.

They have a wonderful free continental breakfast for guests. Bagels and croissants, yoghurt, fruit, hard boiled eggs, coffee and juice. The staff was friendly and kept everything well stocked.

The rooms were large, the soaker tub fantastic and we got a great view of old State House. The decor is very modern and furniture in the room is sparse, making everything feel even more spacious.

I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend it highly to others.

'Great Stay at the Ames'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 23, 2012

person found this review helpful

I stayed one night at the Ames. The hotel is in a perfect location - literally a one minute walk to Faneuil Hall or Downtown Crossing. The front desk was superb and paid attention to my room requests. The room was spacious and very clean. The bathroom was lovely with a rain shower and a heated towel bar. The mini bar, as well as the breakfast (which was complimentary), had plenty of choices! I most enjoyed the hip decor - very different and modern. My only complaint is that I am a light sleeper and the walls are fairly thin. Having said that, I was graciously placed in a corner room and felt as if I had most of the entire floor to myself.

You will not beat this front desk - and you really do get the feeling that the staff will do anything and everything to make your stay special.

I cannot wait to return!

'Different and trendy'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 20, 2012

We got stay at the Ames using Priceline, but being in Boston alot, I've always wanted to stay here (or at least see inside). This is a relatively new renovated hotel in the city.
It is really nice, different and trendy. Our room was full of modern furnishings, beautiful walk-in shower, low bed.. very different from what you find in Boston generally.
Very nice and helpful staff.
Cons- Internet not free, valet parking only.
SemiCons- Slow, tiny elevators

I definitely would say try this hotel for something different, youre close to everything in the city.

'Trendy, great location..'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 16, 2012

Spent 3 nights at the Ames last weekend and was not disappointed. Let me preface my comments by saying- we did have a corner king room with 3 large windows all around, so that may have biased my views, vs. someone who had a smaller room. I am not sure how may windows the non- corner rooms have. Here are some of my observations:
Rooms: As mentioned, our room was very airy and bright, comfy bed, huge bathroom. As others have stated, the dcor is certainly modern, but very trendy and serene at the same time. The bathroom amenities were Malin+ Goetz, very in line with the whole feel of the hotel.

Service: Great service, concierge Charles was very helpful; even when we were out and about, we called him for directions or restaurant reservations, and received them promptly. Everyone we interacted with was friendly and helpful.

Amenities: Free breakfast sounded great, but never woke up in time to make itmade it down at 11.30 one day, and true to good service, the guys cleaning up after breakfast got me a whole tray of pastries/croissants and there was still coffee/tea set out. We did not eat at the restaurant, but had drinks and it was certainly a nice scene, better than any of the neighboring bars/lounges.

Location: Very convenient if you want to do the historic stuff, CVS across the street; 5-7 minute walk to Boston Commons, thru which you can cut thru and reach Newbury street shopping in another 10 mins. Centrally located to reach the North end or even Charles street and the river. Cabs were not quite abundant, so be prepared to wait for one outside the hotel, or just walk!

All in all, a fun, trendy 4 star; as long as you get a spacious room, you should be all set!

Just left the Fairmont Battery Wharf; the front desk, extremely helpful, polite and professional, absolutely awesome. The room, had to run the A/C at 65 degrees just to keep the room cool, don't know why but the room always seemed warm. Very good breakfast; I bought the bed and breakfast option which says free breakfast but somewhere in the fine print it's only good up to $21.09 per breakfast, very strange. What I didn't care for at the Wharf is the bathroom, I don't understand why the bathroom doors (two sliding doors so they never completely come together) are 5 feet from the bed. Without getting too graphic or gross, what this means is whoever is in the bedroom can easily hear all the 'events' going on in the bathroom. In most hotels these doors are usually a solid wall with the bathroom entrance off the entry hallway that would at least allow for some bathroom privacy. The location is great, a 5-10 minute walk to the T and if you buy a day pass you can ride the T, train or bus all day. The water taxi over was fun and a cab ride back to the airport only cost $17.00 and you can't beat the Boston north end.

We returned to the Fairmont Battery Wharf and confirmed it's excellent service, quality and staff friendliness. We had a superb view from the sea from our room and as before excellent quality of linen, and clean facilities. The Aragosta restaurant with it's terrace is a perfect place to dine on summer with excellent wines, tried the lobster diabla and was excellent, service is allways friendly and professional. Near to the north end is at walking distance of little Italy without being in the noise and turmoil. We thank the staff and surely will return, when in Boston.

'Great location but skip the Gold rooms'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 29, 2012

people found this review helpful

We've stayed several times now at the Fairmont Battery Wharf and I want to give my overall impression.

First, the location is terrific. The views of the harbor are great, and it is across the street from the North End and only a 10 minute walk from Faneuil Hall Marketplace. Also, very close to getting onto Route 93.

The property consists of several buildings, some of which are also residential. There is the main building where you check in, and one just across from it where they have one bedroom suites. Another building, just off the water, and not as close as the other two, houses a separate Gold floor of rooms.

We've now stayed in all 3. The main building and one with the larger rooms have the best views. The rooms are nice, spacious, and modern. Bathrooms are large as well. The one bedroom suite is very large and the bathroom is enormous, with a separate tub and shower area. We loved both locations.

We recently stayed at the Gold building. First, it requires a room card key to get in, so if you are checking in there make sure someone is taking in your bags with you or you won't get in. Seperate check in here doesn't have the advantages as it does at other Fairmont properties. Now it took us about 10 minutes tocheck in once we got inside as they had us booked into another room which was already occupied. The room we did get had a nice view, but again set back a little farther from the water.

While the food, both at night and in the morning was very good, the service was poor. Finding any utensils, or a napkin, was a challenge, as well as finding a clean place to sit in the morning. Again, it wasn't like other Gold areas in other Fairmont properties.

We highly recommend staying here, and will do so in the future, but will probably stay in a standard Fairmont room where you get the best room and deal by far.

Very nice hotel and good location. The noise from the hallway was too much!! You could hear everything. Told the front desk about this upon check out and the response was "Yeah, the weddings." So I guess their customer service could be better as well. It was not just loud during the evening hours. Anytime there were people in the hall you could hear their conversations and the garbage trucks on the street. Too bad, it is a pretty hotel with quality bedding.

The harbor side location is very convenient. However the hotel is spread out among multiple buildings making it difficult if traveling with friends. the restaurant was average but has a nice view. The room was adequate. The extra fees however added to an overall rating of average at best. The parking is $42 nightly, internet is $15. We didn't use the business center but it carries a fee as well.

It is a good location to walk to the Old North Church, Paul Revere house and other historical sites. The harbor cruise is within walking distance and a good way to get to the USS Constitution. The Aquarium and Childrens Museum are also an easy walk.

I was very pleasantly priced to find this treasure by the harbour! I've stayed in other places in Boston/Cambridge, but this is definitely my favourite. Service is attentive, the room was especially nice with an incredible view of the harbour. It was also in a great location--a short walking distance to the Aquarium and Old North Church (both not to be missed. Particularly memorable about this place was the great restaurant (highly recommended) and attentive doormen. I am very pleased that Fairmont seems to maintain its excellent service at very reasonable prices (join the free President's Club for internet and other perks).

Nice rooms, clean and updated. Courteous service, and great location. BUT, $15 for internet and $50 for parking at a $500 a night hotel? Plus they charge you to use the business center computer to print out your boarding pass? I get more for my money at a Holiday Inn! It just adds insult to injury, and you certainly don't get these extra charges at a Kimpton...

I Live in Massachusetts and am embarrassed to admit I never had the opportunity to stay at a hotel in Boston- mostly because I lived so close and the expense of it all. Well, my boyfriend and I were invited to a night wedding last week and decided to stay in the city that night. WOW- a friend of his recommended this hotel and I have to say I have NEVER stayed in a hotel so nice- anywhere- Most people have hit the nail on the head in their reviews already, but I loved it so much I wanted to share-
Upon arrival we were greeted by valets who were extremely pleasant, helpful and informative. We got to the room and my gosh- they told me we didn't have a view BUT we were right on the wharf! I don't think there IS a bad view there- we looked right out onto the water....
Amenities included beautiful decor- modern and classy- expresso machine that really worked and produced expresso for real :-) Lovely leather lounger, gorgeous linens and extremely comfortable king size leather bed with huge silk headboard- stunning color coordination- 46" flat screen- huge for a hotel! Tasteful woods and lighting. The hall closet opened up from the bathroom- I LOVED this- so convenient- the bathroom had a large walk in shower with overhead rain shower , large sink area with modern fixtures-
I had a wardrobe malfunction and called the front desk- in 5 minutes a nice woman arrived at the door and proceeded to help me "fix" the situation- sweet-
I could go on and on- if you just want a treat / sneak peek just go in and look at the main lobby ladies room - (ladies! :-) )
Walked to tiny place for a quick breakfast- they held our baggage for us without a problem and suggested where to go even when they had breakfast there- high quality service-
We didn't want to leave.. we just loved it there- seriously - Didn't get to see the building that housed the spa and fitness center- it was huge- in retrospect we should have at least checked it out-
ENJOY this place is you are lucky enough to go there- I could not find a single thing wrong with it- it cannot disappoint! :-)

A very modern, clean and nice hotel, right on the waterfront. Its is convenient for the North end, but not so much downtown. Parking rates were crazy as usual, but we found a space on the road nearby and walked 5 mins.

Our impression of the hotel was heightened by the fact we got an upgrade to a deluxe room. The room was very fancy, immaculate, spacious and comfortable. Got the hotel on a special, but otherwise is expensive, but then again Boston is crazy pricey for nice hotels.

Great stay, that ticked all the boxes.

Great people, place, and price! Beds are important to me and so is ambience...this hotel has both. The service is impecable! We had checked in late for Christmas Eve and then had to have our bags waiting for us the next day as we left for New York, NY. They were on time with the bellhop and the refurbished classic charm of the hotel gives you an almost 1920'2 atmosphere. The elevator is in peak condition and is the oldest in Boston. We loved our view of the city from our room. This hotel was top notch. A must stay! I do recommend passing the hotel and turning around to get to the entrance; It is one a one way street.

'Nice hotel in good location, but...'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 9, 2012 NEW

I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during a recent business trip to Boston. To be honest it was not my first choice and I'll not stay there again if I can help it. The room was perfectly nice and the reception and bar staff perfectly lovely -- but far from what I would have expected given the reviews and the prices.

Let's start with the room. I had a very good room by all accounts, and the bed was nice. But the room was badly laid out and the bathroom was quirky and small with just a single basin (okay for me for a few nights, but hopeless for a couple, or even a woman who would need to do makeup). The AC worked but the thermostat was unreliable so that it was almost impossible to get the temperature comfortable and keep it there. The Internet was wireless and free -- good for a business hotel -- but was slow and kept timing out. The room on the 4th floor was quiet, as requested, and helped by the ice machines being on the odd number floors only.

There is a restaurant that serves breakfast and dinner, but no lunch or room service. And there's nothing to shout about with the food which is expensive for what you get. The seating is uncomfortable and the ambiance, well, what ambiance. The bar is excellent, though, with a good selection of beverages, sensible music, knowledgeable and welcoming staff, and a great feeling. It's probably the best thing about the hotel.

There is valet parking, but it's slow. Cars are kept at a lot across the street and there are simply not enough staff to make it possible for two cars to be moving at the same time, either from or to the hotel. The morning I left I even booked the time I needed the car the previous evening, and still it was not there when I came to leave for the airport.

I would say that this all amounts to a bit of a shame. What could be superb -- nice decor in a great environment, simply fails to impress. I see that other reviewers have noticed some of the same issues I did and still gave 5/5... Perhaps those authors are less sophisticated travelers than I am and have simply not experienced what the best of the boutique hotels are like around the world.

On this trip to Boston, my daughter (23 yrs.) and I went apartment hunting for her. We were extremely luck to get a fabulous rate ($170!!!) through priceline. The Copley Square knows what they are doing and how to take care of their guests. Everyone on the staff was extremely cordial, helpful, well spoken and dressed very professionally. Our first night we were in a King Deluxe room (408) with a very comfortable bed with exquisite linens and pillows. There was a settee next to the window with a decent view. All of the decor (including a casual chandelier over the bed) was very modern and comfortable. The bathroom and closet had plenty of room for 2 women and all that we travel with! Free wifi was a big bonus for us as we were apartment hunting. The 5 - 6 p.m. complimentary wine pour in the lobby was such a nice touch after long days of apartment visits. Then, the housekeeping came around with complimentary bottled water in the evening. I highly recommend this property for all of the above reasons and the fact that it is so centrally located to shopping, restaurants, public transportation, and the historic Boston city!

This gem of a hotel is situated in the heart of Copley Square, within walking distance to the great shopping and dining options. I arrived very early in the morning and was welcomed with complimentary coffee and Leslie at the front desk, who graciously called me when my room was ready. I was not able to make it to Wine Down hour, but they offer a nightly wine reception for guests.

The decor is sophisticated, yet playful with neutral colors brought to life with bold patterns and pops of color. This was the first visit to the Copley Square Hotel, but hopefully not my last.

'Lovely hotel in good location but it's that staff that make it exceptional!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 31, 2012

My girlfriends and I spent our annual "girls" getaway at this lovely old hotel in historic Boston. The rooms were very nice - not overly large, but certainly sufficient, nicely appointed, with good lighting (important as we get older....) and comfortable beds. The rooms are somewhat oddly configured, but that was not totallly unexpected as it is a older building. The fan in our bathroom did not work, it wasn't a real issue for us, but the one in the other room did. The hotel itself was very quiet and is located near teh glorious Boston Public Library, Trinity Church, the Hancock Building, MANY shops and restaurants and Newberry Street. We had no view, unfortunately, but were happy with having quiet after long days of touring around (it is an older hotel so you can't always have everything!) While we all liked the hotel itself, it is the staff that made this an exceptional experience - from the very first bellman to the very last valet. Of special note is Ana, the concierge who seemed to be on the entire Memorial Day weekend. Ana made some great recommendations for restaurants in the area and helped get us in for dinner on a very busy night, on Newberry St. All the staff were friendly and helpful and very well trained - hey, Jude! - I hate to mention individuals when they were all that good. The restaurant in the hotel was opened only for breakfast and dinner. We had breakfast there several mornings - the prices were quite good for a hotel, and the quality was very good. The hotel has a daily "Wine Down" between 5-6PM which we took full advantage of, featuring Californian wines - a very nice touch, after a very busy day of touring. We were able to meet fellow travellers and exchange information about various locations/sites and finds!
One of us utilized the on-site Gym every day and said it was pretty good for a hotel. The password protected WiFi was an unexpected bonus.
I am impressed that Ryan called from the hotel a few days prior before our arrival to confirm the reservation and ask if there was anything more we required other than what we had previously requested, or if he could help to arrange any specific tours or restaurant reservations. He turned out to be one of the concierges on duty when we arrived and was as charming a young man in person as he was on the phone.
My husband and I are now planning a getaway to Boston and will certainly make this hotel our base, as well.

I usually stay in the Back Bay area of Boston due to the central location and the numerous of nearby amenities and attractions. This was the first time I'd stayed at the Copley Square and I can't believe I didn't try it earlier. First impressions were good. Staff on check-in very friendly and efficient and my room and bathroom were definitely a decent size (although I think I was in a 'Deluxe'?). Probably the only thing that let it down was the not so great view of a road, from my window. On a sunny week in Boston though, I wasn't planning on staying in and looking out a window though... Location-wise it's perfect. Literally in the heart of Back Bay, right next to a million shops, restaurants etc, a short stroll from Boston Common and right around the corner from the nearest T stop.

The thing that absolutely impressed me most though was the nice little touches. Not only is there free wifi for example, but also an inclusive 'wine reception' every evening - very nice on return from a day at work! Then there's the card placed in your room every day that informs you of events for that day and the next (my particular favourite being 'National Chocolate Chip Day' on which an enormous and complementary chocolate chip cookies was also placed in my room)...

I would definitely stay here again, particularly considering the price I paid for a last minute trip. Very good value for money.

'Great Location. Microscopic Room.'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed May 26, 2012 via mobile

We bid $140 on Priceline for Memorial Day weekend which must be why were in a tiny room with a queen bed and a small bathroom with barely enough room to use the toilet. Speaking of the toilet, the seat was loose as was the toilet paper holder. There was free Internet but no free water. Even though we were on the 6th floor, the window was not soundproof and we could hear the bar below.

The bed was hard and there was no sheet, just a one piece comforter which is too warm unless the room was freezing. I like just a sheet which most nice hotels now have.

When we left to attend a Red Sox game, I asked for 2 extra pillows to be brought to the room. They were not there when we returned. I called and asked for 2 and they brought one.

'Cozy Room, Good Location, Quiet'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 22, 2012

I knew I was getting a "boutique room". That was fine; it was what I wanted in an historic hotel in Copley Square. After all, Boston is all about History - past, present and future. I liked the historic touches: the elevator, the gorgeous open staircase, the interesting shaped room, the interior doors (closet, bathroom).
My room had a chandelier and several lamps with dimmer switches so I had plenty of light to work at the desk, read in bed, do make up and hair. LOTS of light in the bathroom, which also had a magnifying mirror on an articulating arm. Very handy and nothing I've seen in other hotels.
The well carpeted hall was so quiet, I didn't realise that there were other guests near me.
The AC is central, so it's fairly quiet, unlike window units which are very noisy going on & off all night.
Saw the Gym on my way in & out. There's a bar off the lobby. Password protected Wifi on the premises.
The lobby was kinda dark but I was greeted each time I entered. The concierge was quite helpful, which is great when you're from out of town.
Location was great for me: Copley Square, near the T, the Boston Public Library, the Hynes Convention Center and all the cool shops & restaurants on Newbury St.

The only thing I didn't like was the decor in the room. It was all browns with intriguing patterns (wall paper in the bath has "The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere"!) but I would have liked something a little more in keeping with the historic nature of the building. But it's a hotel and with all the people coming & going, I understand why the furniture was black lacquer.

Should I have another opportunity, I'd be very happy to return to this hotel.

From the moment I was greeted by the valet (with an umbrella) in the pouring rain until the day I left I enjoyed everything about this hotel. The incredible attention to detail in their service, facilities, toiletries and linens - it is worth every cent. The gym is incredibly well equipped for busy road warriors like me and the spa looked divine (although I wish I had time to try it out). The linens were high quality and the food delivered from room service was one of the best meals I have ever experienced from a hotel (hot, delicious, beautifully plated and within a reasonable timeframe). Congratulations to this stylish and charming property - I would definitely stay again next time I find myself in Boston.

The hotel to stay when in town to visit clients in the Financial District. Within walking distance of most firms. Make sure to have a drink at the Bond Bar, apparently one of the most popular meeting places in town. Overall, all the excellence you would expect from the Langham, good value for money given the location and facilities, cannot speak highly enough. Only downside is I had to rush off in the morning and had to miss the full English breakfast. Next time!

Nice hotel, stayed here for 2 nights in middle of May. Staff are friendly and helpful. Great location for discovering the city and was great value.

Good location, good room with plenty of space, great location. BUT paying a separate fee for Wifi was annoying and if you have more than one device it'll cost you a bomb. In fact there's no indication that at it's available at all unless you ask. The room could have done with more powerpoints too, but that's a minor quibble. If you don't care about the WiFi, I'd recommend it highly.

'Would have been better with a nicer room'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 5, 2012

I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. Overall my experience was good-- the staff was friendly and helpful, the amenities in the room were nice and the room, while small, had very high ceilings which made it feel more spacious and grand. Probably the biggest perk were the sheets... so comfortable and felt like thin velvet. I slept great! On the down side, I was in a handicapped accessible room and they were unable to switch me to another so the bathroom was pretty unusual, in particular the shower which looked like it was straight out of a $80 a night hotel (thin plastic shower curtain liner with no other shower curtain, really small, mediocre shower head that wouldn't stay on straight so the water was always hitting the back wall instead of me, and peeling wall paper around the edges and near the shower stall). The shower made the whole experience in the room pretty unpleasant, especially at $350 or so a night. I did use the fitness center which was small but nice and had a drink at Bond, the restaurant/club in the lobby and that was also very fun. Overall, a good experience but bummed I didn't get a nicer room. I understand the need to have accessible rooms for those with disabilities but that doesn't give the hotel an excuse to make it really sub-par, especially at the rates the hotel charges.

My girlfriend and I went for a weekend in Boston in June. We picked the Westin Copley because it was close to shopping and restaurants. We were blown away by the exceptional service and beautiful rooms. When we arrived after a two hour delay on the tarmac, we were greeted with a complimentary upgrade! They had lots of suggestions on restaurants, tours and shopping. The Hotel is connected to everything! My girlfriend and I are both very busy Moms, and the weekend away was just what we needed. I was able to go to the gym, get my hair done, have breakfast, all the while with smiling faces around me asking how they can be of assistance.

We also ordered room service - the food is exceptional.

This is a superb Hotel and I would reccomend if you have a chance, you should stay here! I will be going back for sure.

Thankfully I arrived in the mid-afternoon because the hotel was oversold and they had to turn away guests the later it got in the day. This Westin is in a great spot - next to a lot of shops, restaurants and some bars.

Check-in went smoothly. My room, on the 35th (out of 36) floor had a great view of the city. I liked the extra touch of an extension cord to accommodate the various devices one needs to charge.

I was especially delighted to have a voice mail from hotel management about joining their 'running concierge' for a run around the city and the Charles River the next morning at 6:30 a.m. Who knew such a thing existed?! In spite of a late night out, I made it down to the lobby, joined by a few other guests and we did five miles. Learned a bit more about the city and got a great work-out in! Apparently this event occurs on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

I found the staff very friendly, the Heavenly bed heavenly and the room clean. My only nits are: $47 for overnight valet parking (which persuaded me to not have a rental on this biz trip), sometimes slow elevators - considering the number of floors and the number of elevators available, you'd think you wouldn't wait too long, and one day where the internet connectivity was spotty or non-existent.

'Even below convention hotel standards.'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 11, 2012 NEW via mobile

Agree with another recent post that there are many better options for less money. For over four hundred bucks why not include wifi? For a while during our recent stay no escalators worked to take guests from the second floor lobby to street level. Elevators were crammed with people because the stairs as an alternative are badly placed and essentially only fire escapes. Our room filled with the stench of mold when we turned on the air conditioning. The next morning we awoke to find everything in the room covered with a fine white dust. I phoned the front desk but received no satisfactory response. Agree also toilet pressure too low. Shower handle was broken, i had to call down for a shower cap, same soap and toiletry items as a Sheraton although mouth rinse wasn't left in the bathroom til the fourth day.Too busy with conference to pay attention to hotel shortcomings we stuck it out but next Boston trip will find us staying further even if it means taxi fare to the convention centre...it will be well worth it to be away from the hassles here.

We came to visit Boston for the weekend of my daughter's birthday and I have to say at first I wasn't thrilled to be spending a long weekend in Boston when we could've gone somewhere warmer, but this is where she wanted to spend it since she hopes to go to college here in 2015. We arrived at the airport at 1200 and I thought it was too early to check in so I called the Westin to see if we could at the very least check in our luggage. To my surprise I was informed our room was ready & we could check in as soon as we arrived.....Hmm, this was starting out to be a pretty good afternoon. Check-in was short & sweet, Thank you so much Kelly for helping out with EVERYTHING the Thursday we arrived, I hope my mother wasn't too overwhelming to deal with;)

Our room was on the 22nd floor & upon arrival I noticed everything was in order, the room & bathroom both very clean & well kept. When we arrived from lunch our roll away was in the room as requested upon check-in. The beds where very comfy, super clean linens & trust me when I say I am VERY thorough when checking hotels rooms out, my mother (who also accompanied us on this trip) has worked in the hotel business in NYC for over 25 years & she was with me and also praised the room on how well it was maintained.

We ate in the hotel for all 3 meals each day at either The Huntington (for breakfast) and Bar 10 ( for lunch & dinner) and all our meals were totally awesome as was the service. Marie at The Huntington was such a sweetie pie! Thank you so much for such lovely service. I felt like I was visiting family with her as our morning server. Amanda was also very friendly & attentive to us at Bar 10. My daughter loved the Red Velvet cake she gave her on her birthday, thanks again! We all loved all the shops inside the attached mall area, although a bit on the expensive side, it was still fun to walk around & browse. Loved the fact that we could buy our duck boat tour tickets in this mall then turn around and shop at Barnes & Noble and so many other great stores.

The highlight of our stay was the surprise birthday cake sent up on the morning of my daughter's birthday. She was just thrilled to see such a lovely set up for her on her special day! It was delicious & I'm sure her favorite dessert on this trip. Thank you to everyone involved in setting up & coordinating this from NYC to Boston, I appreciate it so much! In the end, I have to say we had such an excellent time in Boston and I have to thank The Westin Copley Place for doing such a great job taking care of us & totally changing my idea on how this trip was going to end up. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone interested in visiting Boston with family to stay here.

Check in went very smoothly and we were assigned a nice room on the 31st floor with a great view of the city. Bed was very comfortable as Westin beds usually are. Room was large and easily accommodated us.
We were attending a hockey tournament and were not showering in the room somedays so we weren't using the towels. The room attendant kept bringing more towels and by the end of our stay we had a stack of 8 clean towels on the counter. I just thought it was a bit funny. We walked to many of the tourist and shopping spots as well as Fenway Park. 2 Subway stops are steps away from the hotel and we had no problem getting around. We didn't eat in the hotel and can't comment on the restaurants or bar.

Great location, nice rooms, good service, I had no real complaints.
Our party arrived early to check in, about 11am, but our two rooms were still not ready till 2pm, ahead of check in, but later than we would have perferred.

Also, their breakfast buffet is not your best option. We had it on the weekend with the expanded service (and price) to include an omlette station. The price is too high for what you get ($30 each I believe) and the food is rather bland. There are so many places to eat in Boston, go elsewhere.

On the other hand, Turner Fisheries was a delight! Excellent service and ambience, the food was wonderfully presented and tasty (although portions were rather small, seafood appitizers are not meant to be shared) and the price in line with other local restaurants.

The hotel bar was also quite nice. It was very lively each night of our stay and althought we went elsewhere for our entertainment we found ourselves stopping in for a nightcap on our way back to our room due to the atmosphere.

As you point out check in time is 3pm and we endeavor on every occasion to get guests in as soon as we can, but it all depends on the check out patterns of the previous night's guests and if we were sold out. Sorry to hear about the buffet...I will personally take a look at that tomorrow with an eye towards upgrading it...I cannot agree with you more about our Sustainable Seafood Restuarant, Turner Fisheries...we believe it to be the best in the city, and in fact were voted number one in Boston by City Search!

'As you would expect from a Westin hotel.'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 5, 2012

Stayed here for 5 nights after a 4 night stay at the Hyatt Regency in Downtown Boston. Was in Boston attending two conferences.
The check in process here was efficient. I got the impression that it was a very busy hotel and that the room allocated to me was not ready at the time of check in. The receptionist did a bit of searching and found me a great room on a high floor - 2705.

The view is spectacular, don't get me wrong.

Upon entering the room there was an intense buzzing from the ventilator which soon disappeared with some tapping on the grille. However, the fan or whatever belt was used to power the fan sounded like a jet turbine whenever it came on, ie whenever it was working !

The floor supervisor happened to knock on my door and even open my door about 2 minutes after I entered the room - I gathered this unannounced entry was due to the fact that the front desk had randomly allocated my room and this woman did not realise it. She was very polite, a little bit flustered, but not in the least interested when I told her about the vent.

Being tired and extremely jet lagged despite staying in boston for 4 days prior, I decided to give the room a try and see how it went. The sound after all appeared to be confined in the entry hallway initially.

By the 2nd night the sound was a constant annoyance and I rang the service number who sent the engineer round during the day when I was out for the meeting. I returned to find that the sound was only slightly reduced and there were dust bunnies all over the room - a sign that the vent had been freed. I endured my last night with pillows over my head and the fan switched to a temperature that didn't come on frequently.

Another thing was the room was supposed to be newly renovated, but the entire shower apparatus on the wall kept coming off. The handle holds the tap and the chrome faceplate onto the wall and the handle itself was loose. This was rectified by the engineer though.

I had the opportunity to have breakfast in the hotel on my last morning, which was good. The maitre'd was very welcoming and efficient. All the staff were helpful overall. The gym was well equipped and extremely crowded come 6:30 in the morning.

Locationwise - I got bored from this location as the only attractions around the area are shops and the boston duck tours. I benefitted much more from the hyatt being close to all the happening places whereby food and touristy bits were much closer.

the overall feel from the hotel was that this is a nice hotel but the focus is on the numbers and they do not place enough emphasis on the upkeep and maintenance of the building. The side entryway from the lobby to the street had a revolving door which had a broken handle and was still not fixed when I left despite one day of the door being cordoned off with cautionery tape.

Only thing I have to say is I paid $100 more per night at the westin compared to the hyatt regency for a room half the size, and three times as noisy from the ventilation. Avoid room 2705 and stay here if you feel like paris hilton and are extravagant. Otherwise value for money awaits elsewhere.

Thank you for your comments about your recent stay in Boston. I am sorry to hear that your stay did not live up to your expectations and I apologize for any inconvenience we casued you. I am not sure why the vent was so loud, but I am more concerned with the follow up or lack thereof from engineering and housekeeping...I will be sure to address this with both departments. The rooms have been recently renovated which inlcuded that shower head and spiget...again a lapse by the housekeeping department in not reporting it to be fixed. I am really surprised that you got bored by the location and thought the downtown location offered mre to do...perhaps we did not do a good job on directing you to the myriad of attractions close by. It would help me tremedously if I could speak to you a bit more about your experience. Perhaps if you had a moment you could reach out to me at michael.jorgensen@westin.com

Once again my apologies and I look forward to speaking soon.

'Fine experience during stressful stay'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 4, 2012

A stayed here for one night back in April to take a very stressful exam. Thankfully, the staff gave me no problems and made my stay as stress free as they could. Check in was quick, request for quiet room granted, late check out granted. Room was pleasantly large for a Boston hotel. Large flat screen, comfy bed, bathroom clean. Hotel is close to many nice restaurants, which the concierge pointed out in timely manner. Obviously, the hotel is on the more expensive side, but, especially in big city hotels, you get what you pay for. I WOULD stay here again and WOULD recommend it for business travelers. No comment on family stays since I was not in this mindset during my trip!

'Absolutely loved it'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 18, 2012

Start with the location: in the heart of Beacon Hill, steps from The Public Garden, near The Boston Common underground parking garage. Then the warm, welcoming staff. Then the design/graphics look of the place (very important to me): simple and clean (in all senses of the word) but warm and welcoming. Then the staff: friendly, knowledgeable, really pleasant to talk to.
The room was very nice. Small, but thoughtfully and tastefully furnished. No crappy hotel stuff. Like a nice bedroom in a nice housekinda modern, but with a traditionalist sensibility.
Loved the third floor terrace! Overlooking the street, with lots of light. Delightful. The complimentary breakfast was amazing. Not just some "continental" thing with some carbs and yogurt, this is a full menu. Order whatever you like, all complimentary (they just add a gratuiity).
The hotel was so quiet, I assumed we were maybe the only guests. Was shocked to hear that it was booked! Guess it's partly a credit to the clientele: not exactly the rowdy type.
Can't wait to return. Truly.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout my stay. A great location in the middle of two subway stops with different lines which made it very easy to do my own touring. A big plus was that free breakfast is included in the hotel price and the restaurant had an excellent selection of breakfast items. Definitely worth going to.

I love Beacon Hill, quaint streets and shops, like a clean Victorian scene.

Best place to stay is the BHHB. The rooms are small but beautifully decorated, nice bathrooms and all mod cons.
Comfortable big bed.

The breakfasts are huge eand yummy.

This place is not a proper hotel, it is a restaurant with rooms. Do not expect a lobby, big bar, room service etc.
But you can expect a comfortable stay in lovely surroundings in a great part of Boston.

'The best Boston has to offer'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed March 19, 2012
3
people found this review helpful

The Beacon Hill Hotel and Bistro is a wonderful hotel in the historic Beacon Hill neighbourhood of Boston.

It is very well located, making it easy to walk to the Boston Common, Newbury Street, and downtown. Other parts of the city can be reached by taxi, which are not overly expensive compared to some other destinations. Beacon Hill itself is enchanting, with shops, cafes, and beautiful architecture.

Our room was on a street corner several floors up, giving us a great view of the intersection near the hotel and providing plenty of light into the room. The room itself was relatively small but very comfortable, with a great bed and modern bathroom facilities. Our room was at one extremity of the hotel, making Wifi unreliable but there is a quiet lounge area on the second floor in the hotel where the Wifi can be accessed without problem.

One of the best parts of our stay was the bistro on the main floor of the restaurant. It is decorated in a simple but classic style that fits very well into Beacon Hill's feel. The food was excellent, and the bar is a great place to relax after a day of walking around the city.

The breakfasts were incredible. They were included with the room but you are able to choose anything from the bistro's breakfast menu. This is no continental breakfast - during our stay we had everything from the standard eggs and hash-browns (with toasted warm sourdough bread) to pancakes and yogourt with granola and fresh fruit.

The hotel also has a roof-top patio with chairs and tables. A great place to sit and people watch, and the site of our engagement!

Parking is a little tricky since the hotel is located in a dense, historic neighbourhood. Parking at the nearby Boston Common was cheap enough, and since you can get around on foot or taxi it is good place to leave your car during your stay.

We strongly recommend the Beacon Hill Hotel and Bistro and look forward to our next stay - for us, the hotel itself is worth the visit to Boston.

Great location a block from Boston Common and Parking at Boston Common. Room was clean and cozy- felt like a guest room at a friend's house more than a hotel. Breakfast is included in the room price and it is out of sight (and I'm a total food snob). 18% gratuity added to room charge for breakfast at the bistro but WOW! so tasty. And the service was great- felt very welcome.

5 of 5 stars Reviewed November 27, 2011

people found this review helpful

The Beacon Hill Hotel and Bistro were everything I'd hoped for on a three-day trip to Boston...good location for lots of sight-seeing, quiet, pretty retreat every evening, personal service (not many rooms, so the staff knows who you are) but not so intensely personal as that at a bed-and-breakfast. I was able to get to many places on foot from this hotel and public transportation is a short walk across Boston Common. The staff is knowledgeable and most willing to assist you in getting to know the area. Even when they were busy with the bistro end of the business (the check-in desk performs dual functions for hotel and bistro), I was never neglected.

The room I had was small but well-appointed and perfect for a single traveler. With two windows, there was plenty of light; so I never felt confined by the space. I'd definitely choose to stay here again.

If you expect a separate check-in desk and a hotel lobby, this is not the place for you. Also, if you need elevator assistance, be sure to mention that when making your reservation. Staying in certain rooms requires climbing stairs in this charming little inn.

Great boutique hotel near North Station, ideal location for walking round Boston or for getting on the subway or trains. Small hotel and quite small rooms at premium prices. Rooms nicely laid out with good amenities, all pretty high standard.

The wine reception not quite what we were expecting - don't expect an Embassy Suites free bar, think more a meet and great in the lobby with other guests. No freebies in the room either which would have been nice at the price - not even a coffee machine.

Staff all very friendly and free wifi.

'excellent service'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 11, 2012 NEW

thanks to tripadvisor i found kate, who i sent an email to organize my booking here. she was extremely responsive and did a great job assisting me. i booked with a corporate rate on the phone, which saved us a good amount of money. we had a total of 4 rooms here, organized well and close to each other. the staff at check in knew who we were right away as they were expecting us. the companion goldfish made it to each room which was great and everyone was enjoying the company. we stayed for 2 nights and valet was just too much for our group so we opted to park at the governement center garage (google this!) which is literally a 2 block walk away on congress street. it is also the official parking for TD Garden. the rates are very affordable on weekends if there is no event, even if there is an event its cheaper than valet at the hotel.

the double deluxe rooms as noted by a staff are all non-street facing which meant we were away from the noise (if any) from the bars. you can request for a room on a higher floor which we did. the rooms are at 280 sq feet, which are small but in most city hotels the hotel rooms are tiny. the bathroom was bigger than usual but i love big bathrooms for my comfort. the sink was huge, which was also great, and there was a good space between the toilet the sink and the tub. the curtains on the tub expanded outward which meant it can accommodate a larger person comfortably as well. the water pressure was good too. the air condition in our room was loud enough to notice but if it wasnt pointed out on tripadvisor i wouldnt even have taken note of that. we slept well and it did not bother us. we did have room 801 as one of the rooms and the air condiitioner wasn't working well, they sent up an engineer to fix it but it was still very humid and damp/muggy in the room the rest of our stay.

the area is pretty deserted but this weekend we were there it so happened to be the final game 7 between heat and celtics so the bars brought in lots of people and there was a gay parade on saturday as well. the 7 eleven was extremely convenient for us as the drinks are super duper cheap there. the location is in good proxiimity to quincy market and faneuil hall, less than 10 minutes if you got the directions correct. also close to some good eats. if it werent for the game on saturday night i think we would have scored free parking on the street til sunday when we checked out. the T is also close by in case you want to navigate to the other tourist attractions in boston, but boston isnt exactly abundant in parking so no matter where you stay your best option would probably be to take the T anyway.

overall a good stay and great accommodations. i wished that would have been able to arrange light breakfast and croissants or something for us in the morning that we could have grabbed to go. it wouldn't cost too much extra and it would have definitely peaked the review and experience to a 5 star.

We spent one night here because we were watching a game at TD Garden that night. The hotel is literally within steps of the Garden. The check-in and check-out process ran really smoothly. We were also celebrating an anniversary, so they upgraded our room to a penthouse suite (even without our request) -- that was very thoughtful and well appreciated. I'm not sure if I really like the decor of the hotel though, but that's my only complaint.

Some tips: If you are attending an event at the Garden, there is a discount via the TD garden website. Cabs take about 5-10 minutes if you want to call one -- this isn't NYC, where you can just hail one.

'Slightly dissapointed'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 7, 2012

As a Kimpton In-Touch member I try to stay at their properties as they are usually reliably nice. I found this property to be substandard to others I've stayed at. Paid $350 a night for a package that included parking and breakfast. The room was very cramped and you had to squeeze between the chair and bed to get around. Couldn't open the closet all the way due to the position of door and couldn't access the safe at all. Breakfast arrived cold and was inedible. The windows don't open, which I don't care for. Drunks on street below after Celtics game kept us awake on a night when we really needed some rest. Decor was boring and not very classy - one step above a chain such as Hampton etc. Bed was OK, pillows just OK but better than others during our 8 day multi-city trip. Neighborhood oddly cut off from rest of city. Would not stay here again.

I decided to surprise my son with a trip to Boston to see the Celtics vs. Heat for the Eastern Conference finals (he is a Heat fan!). The hotel was not only ideal in terms of location, but the atmosphere was wonderful....great staff, unique decor, and a welcoming tone. The valet was very friendly and prompt. I will definitely make it a point to stay here again as we go to Boston quite often but this was our first time at this hotel. The room was not as small as expected, perhaps it was because it was a handicapped room or I just know to expect small rooms at hotels in the city. Despite staying over on a night when the Celtics won, it was surprisingly quiet. Thank you for making this an extra special experience for me and my son! -Virginia

This is a very nice hotel. Clean and very nicely appointed rooms (contemporary style). The staff is outstanding. Depending on where your business in the city is, the hotel might not be be walking distance to your destination - other hotels in the city might be more convenient from this perspective. However, the hotel is only 2 blocks from the North Station T-stop - green and orange lines. I stayed here during a convention when other hotels where I usually stay were much more expensive, and the saving was well worth it.

Hotel was very clean and the decor was modern. I traveled for business and a number of us agreed that the beds were very comfortable. I stayed in a double and found the room to be a bit smaller than I'm used to but it worked out fine. Only negative thing was that our double room only had one tiny window (with a bad view).

It's a bit off the beaten path and is a bit of a walk to get to any decent restaurants, I wouldn't walk alone but maybe that's just me.

With all of that said, I would stay again.

4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 14, 2012 NEW

Other than the fact that the elevators smelled a little musty (which isn't really a problem because you don't spend a lot of time in the elevators), this was a very nice hotel. The room was clean and fresh, and the pillows/beds were very comfortable.

Our room had 2 double beds (a little smaller than queen beds), and the room was the size of a typical hotel room. By looking at the floorplan on the back of the door, we noticed that most of the other rooms on the floor were a lot bigger (more like suites, I suspect). However, we had plenty of space in our room.

We were in Boston on business, and typically stay in the financial district, but this time we decided to try staying in Back Bay. What a beautiful area! One block over, on Newbury Street, was block after block of trendy shopping and outdoor dining. You can easily take the subway or a taxi to the financial district, but the weather was nice so we walked. It was about a 35 minute walk, which we didn't mind since the weather was beautiful.

I would definitely stay here again!

'Perfect Location for Fenway and Public Gardens'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 7, 2012

A very nice older style boutique hotel in a perfect location. Reminded me a little of the nice 3 star hotels in Paris but The Eliot was much larger. Beds were super comfy. We had a Suite that had 2 double beds and a large living room. The bathroom was marble tile: shower, walls and floor. Plenty of hot water. We were 2 couples and the space was more than adequate. I called the desk for extra towels and they were delivered promptly. Parking is $36. a night. I booked thru Bookit,com and got a $550. room for $335. including taxes. An easy walk to Fenway and the Public Gardens. Be sure to ride the beautiful Swan Boats; only $2.75./person. Room service coffee was $5. for a small pot but it was hot and very, very good. Three pots was plenty for 4 people. We did not have breakfast at the hotel restaurant (looked a little pricey). Went to the top of the Prudential instead and it was a special treat. Very elegant and moderately priced with a fantastic view of Boston. The best part was my boyfriend was asked to remove his baseball cap!

Wanted to stay in town for the Red Sox game (they won against the Oriels in last inning with questionable hommer..but yea!!) ANd ran into 2 conventions in town so after calling 10 hotels, LUCKED into getting the last 2 rooms they had for the one night!!! I usually stay at the Boston Harbor (LOVELY) but no availabilities there. We arrived at this quaint looking brownstoneish hotel in the back bay AND now have another favorite place in Boston!!! The location is absolutely fantastic being close to Newbury street and within walking distance of Fenway which was great for us. The lobby is small BUT who cares!!! We checked in fast and went straight to rooms at the 3:00 check in time. The rooms were spacious and the bed uber comfy!!! Great suite layout! Bathrooms were a little small but totally fit with the ambiance of the hotel!!! The staff was professional and warm and had we stayed longer, I'm sure we would have had a better scope of all they could offer! The treats in the room upon arrival were SWEET!!! Best cookie and gummies EVER!!! The street was busy and a bit noisy BUT I can honestly say that with the layout of the room, my sleep was VERY PEACEFUL! It was a quick stay BUT will be going back!!! It's a great place even with the kids because it is close to many things AND they have tvs in room as well as the sitting area! One room had a HUGE computer with touchscreen (free internet...nice...not sure why our other room didn't have the computer..). It was a great surprise to find such a treasure of a hotel at the last hour...and will stay here again!! Also good for romantic weekend because it's so close to soooo many fun places....within crawling distance if you know what I mean!!! Give it a try!!!

'A grand old hotel in Boston'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 29, 2012

We were in Boston to see some Red Sox games, so we wanted to stay on back bay, near Fenway Park. This hotel is within walking distance of Fenway. It is a charming old brownstone building. All of the rooms are suites. We had a very comfortable king size bed and a nice sitting room with a couch and two chairs. The bathroom was tiny, but beautiful with Italian marble floors. It has a sushi bar and a restaurant, but we didn't try either. My only complaint was that even though we had the air conditioner set at 65, it was still too warm at night.

'A Decent Alternative To The Chains'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 7, 2012

Our family of four spent 3 nights at The Eliot in April 2012 and had a generally positive experience. The hotel is located close to shopping and dining on Newbury Street and within walking distance of a subway stop and Fenway. Our suite was large and comfortable, although the furniture and bathroom fixtures were beginning to show their age as were the elevator cars. The beds were of recent vintage and the hotel staff went out of their way to be helpful. The in-room computer was fine for simple tasks, but would be awful for serious work. If you want a good, quasi-European alternative to the traditional chains for vacation travel, the Eliot might be worth a look.

We stayed 4 nights at this hotel at the end of April and were very pleased. Not having visited Boston before it was a bit of a shot in the dark as regards location but it couldn't have been better. It was very close to the Italian part of town, right opposite Faneuil Hall and Qunicy markets and within walking distance of many major sights. The Freedom Trail went right past. The room was spacious and very comfortable. The only negative, I suppose, was that the air conditioning was quite loud but we just turned it off at night.

I stayed here recently for two nights. The location of this place is very good. It is walking distance to Quicy and the harbor.

I stayed in room 626. Even after a quick shower, the floor outsite the shower area floods. It's a shame because the bathroom is sooooo nice. The shower system is really nice.

The bed is nice and firm. The entire place is very clean, no funky smell.

They did charge ~$10 for Internet, which I thought was a rip off. So I went across the street to Starbucks to use their Wifi while getting my coffee.

The room has a complimentry umbrella in the closet. The umbrella became useful since it rained on the day I was there.

I don't think the service is all that. When I got there, I asked the service desk person how do I get to TD Garden. The guy just handed me the local touristy map and asked me to look for it on there. I was like: Really?!

Overall, the hotel is nice. The location is good and clean. But the service and quality is bad. Would not stay here again.

'Amazing Location but that's about it!'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed May 31, 2012

I recently stayed at this property for (1) Saturday night. You really can not choose a better location. Seconds from Quincy Market and a 5 minute walk to the North End(Little Italy) best cannoli's around. I would describe this hotel as a boutique hotel. Entrance and lobby very modern and chic as were the rooms. The valet gentlemen were very helpful and attentive (steep overnight charge of $45). So here are my issues -
*no free wifi which is okay except for the fact that if you travel with a laptop, cell phone, ipad etc. you will be charge $9.95 per device per day to access the wifi.
*bottle of Fiji water in the room $6.50
*don't even think about touching the mini-bar as if you tap it you will be charged
*Bathroom is lovely, no bath tub just a beautiful shower - only problem is that the entire bathroom floor gets flooded when you shower. I slipped getting out of the shower because of all the water ( and yes, I had the floor towel down). I made mention of this to the front desk when I checked out but they didn't seem to care and said they would make a note of it.
*hotel does not have ice machines but you can request from room service "complimentary" which means you still have to tip the person who is bringing you the ice.

All in all, great location but for the price of this hotel, there are plenty of others that I would stay at next time in Boston. Just felt like I was getting gauged every turn I took at this hotel.

I booked an overnight stay via Priceline and received a fantastic rate! Drove up to
Boston for the day with my boyfriend and unfortunately my car window got smashed and items were stolen downtown. We thought we wouldnt be able to stay at the hotel because of that incident, however the hotel was very accommodating of our needs. They offered for us to leave our car parked in the roundabout valet section so that there would be an attendant keeping an eye on it at all times. Blown away by the guest service skills! Not only that, but upon checkin they were even kind enough to upgrade our room to a suite. Totally unexpected, but a pleasant surprise to say at the least. They tried to help remedy a problem that we experienced in Boston that had nothing to do with their hotel- that's incredibly kind. The room itself was meticulous. Awesome location. Would recommend to anyone!

This hotel is right next to Quincy Market.. Although it may not look like much on the outside, it has just gone under a massive rennovation and is now a modern looking hotel from the inside.

The hotel rooms are generous sized. there is a walkway that opens up into a big bathroom with oversized shower. Little bathroom amentites like cotton buds, cotton balls, mouthwash, shampoo, conditioner, body moiseteriser and body wash are available. So is a hairdryer.

It may get a little noisy at night, depending on the foot traffic outside, but you can't complain about that as you're in a prime location.

Walking distance to Hannover Street (little italy) which is fantastic. The best canolis I've ever had in my life can be found at Mike's Pastry.

'Excellent Stay in Boston'

Just got back from a mini trip to Boston. We booked this hotel based on the location, as we wanted to be close to the food and shops. We were not disappointed. The hotel is in the best spot in the North End; you can't beat that for the money! Steps away from Quincy Market, the water, and the subway. Our room was big, modern and comfortable, and had all the amenities we needed. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful.
We appreciated the convenience of the valet parking, but it seemed expensive at $45 a day. It was also great that the hotel let us check in early, but they also charged a $12 early check in fee to park. Our only other complaint was that there didn't seem to be any soda machine or ice machine anywhere in the hotel.
Those small things aside, we will definitely return to this hotel and are already planning our next trip to Boston!

'Good for Business'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 12, 2012 NEW

Considering this hotel is right in the Business District in Boston, I should have realized it was basically business oriented. Do not get me wrong, it is a beautiful hotel; well appointed, great staff and well situated to downtown Boston. The only thing I found lacking was, no restaurant for breakfast. From what I understand you have to order room service for breakfast which is expensive ( thus the very good rating instead of excellent). $10 for a bagel with cream cheese plus 18% gratuity and tax added on. We did not starve, the valet sent us to a great little deli
( Scali) which is frequented by the locals where a bagel with cream cheese is $2.50 and bacon and eggs special was $4.49.
The room itself was gorgeous with a spa like bathroom, quiet and huge. Standard room $470 but large enough to feel like a suite.
Location is great, incredible if you are here for business. It is only a five block walk to Quincy market and it is located at Independence wharf. The Boston Tea Party Museum can be seen from the restaurant ( which opens at 11am). The restaurant has a patio out on the wharf.
Great place for combining business and pleasure.

I stayed here in May 2012 while attending a conference. The hotel is really nice, with big rooms, large bathrooms with showers and tubs, and quiet, even though the hotel was full.
The concierge was really helpful finding restaurants. Recommended us a superb grill; and a really nice place in Chinatown.
Location is perfect for business, close to several investment firms and also South Station.
It also has a nice fitness center and heated pool (this last one I didn't use).
Only complain is about room service. Even though the food was fine and service was really fast, I found it really expensive, with several charges that in the end increase the bill a lot. Breakfast is average and also overpriced.

My husband and I stayed here Memorial Day weekend for a long weekend. The hotel is in a great location on the water right by the harbor.

We took a water taxi from the airport which was a lot of fun. The hotel has a dock right out back where you can request a water taxi to take you anywhere on the harbor.

We did not eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel but they did look rather classy, so bring something nice to wear. We walked across the bridge to the Barking Crab and had wonderful crab legs and lobster. We also had amazing cupcakes at Crumbs bakery just down the street.

The concierge was very helpful when we asked what was the best way to get to Harvard.

South Station is a 5 minute walk from the hotel which gives you access to the subway.

The nice thing about Boston is that it is small enough that you can really walk anywhere, and you want to because there is so much to see.

My only complaint about the hotel is the bed. It was horribly hard and fairly uncomfortable. For a high priced hotel like the InterContinental I expect a much better bed.

We did have a street view of the fire station but hardly ever heard the sirens, they rarely went off.

We spent a night at this hotel before continuing our road trip to Cape Cod. The arrival experience was very nice, valet took care of us and showed us the way in. Weird to see them taking my car key and just placing in outside the car on the top of the windshield (this is wrong). The room was nice but all furnitures were almost a foot away from the walls what made it small. The head board had one of those greasy stain. The shower had mold and mildew in the corners - not too apparent but enough to question if they really follow their cleaning standards. The pool area was very nice but not clean. The restaurant was very nice - we had an amazing breakfast service and the food was very good and not expensive. The staff was always there to assist. Great service! Other than that, great location, great concierge services (I forgot his name but he was Canadian). A major negative aspect - for over 40$ for parking, I would expect at least a proper valet service. As I mentioned already, the key left on the windshield after my check in was just wrong. Then you have to go pick your car up in a hot garage??? I thought it was VALET... I should have used the self park next door instead. On the top of that, we were never helped with the bags upon check out. It seemed like they were there to drive cars only... Overall we enjoyed our stay but these minor details made us think that hotel is not really service oriented.

'Rooms are beautiful!!'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 31, 2012

We stayed here May 26th, 2012 and really enjoyed our stay. We booked 2 rooms next to each other, a king standard room and a room with 2 double beds for my family. The rooms are beautifully appointed. The beds are very comfortable. I did use the extra pillow from the closet. Our bathroom had a really nice soaking tub and a nicely sized shower. The rooms were very spacious and had lots of seating which came in handy because we ordered room service at 1AM after a Red Sox game and all pigged out together. It was really fun, the food was great, service was friendly. Parking was a little expensive at $40. There were only two negatives, and they were very minor. When we got back from the baseball game, we wanted to relax at the water front bar area. When we walked out there we realized we were VERY under dressed. They told us they were closing in 45 minutes, last call was in 15 minutes and we could order from the bar, but couldn't get wait service. The staff was a little chilly towards us, but no big deal. We were all wearing Red Sox gear and felt a little silly. The other minor negative was that our hotel windows faced the Fire station. We could slightly hear the fire engines taking off. It was pretty muffled and only happened a couple times, but my husband and I are both pretty light sleepers. If you're a light sleeper, I would request a room that faces a different direction. Overall, the hotel was great and I would stay there again (and bring a dress!).

'Great Hotel, but the beds....'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 29, 2012

Just got back from a 5-night stay with the family (wife, and boys ages 13 and 11). Great hotel, great staff, good location, but the beds are are very, very, firm. Really is a top notch hotel- parking is expensive ($40/night), but that's par for the course in Boston. Staff was very friendly and went out of their way to accommodate..... but I (and the family) just couldn't get over the beds. If you don't mind stiff sleeping arrangements, I would not hesitate to stay here. Typically I find comparable hotels have much more comfy beds.

The hotel was top notch and beautiful. We were treated awesome. The restaurants and bars were better than normal hotel quality and we were very impressed. Everything was immaculate. Location was great.

When we went ot check out, we were told that we would have to go get our car from the garage, though we paid $49 for valet parking. You can drop it off in front, but you have to go to the back of the hotel and take an elevator down into the garage, where we had to wait and show that we had paid for parking. Minor inconvenience, but it was over 90 degrees outside and it was stifling in the garage. We waited over 20 minutes in the garage, hot, as the attendants brought us the wrong car twice. There needs to be a better system. If I were to be in town again, I would stay there only if I didn't bring my car.

'Perfect choice'

The bathroom alone sold me on this property, because it was so huge and luxurious. I loved the fact that there was a hug bathtub, as well as a separate shower. The location was perfect, so we felt particularly lucky since it was our first trip to Boston and we had picked this hotel pretty much at random. The only criticism I have is that there was a charge to use the internet. I was shocked at this because it seemed so cheap of them, given all the luxury we were surrounded by. I've stayed in some real dumps where the internet was free, so I assumed it was a given everywhere. However, this small fact in no way interfered with our overall enjoyment of the property.

I also was very impressed by the gym which was well equipped and had a large indoor pool attached, which unfortunately I didn't have time to experience.

I recently planned a gathering at Kemble Inn for the non-profit I work for. The team at Kemble Inn was absolutely TERRIFIC. They were helpful, considerate and efficient. The food was also divine  there was a running joke during the event that if we moved the crab cakes to where we wanted people to go they would follow. Our staff was very pleased with the outcome of the event and our guests are still talking about it.

Our experience at the Kemble Inn truly set a new standard for event locations in the Berkshires.

'wonderful weekend in the berkshires...'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed February 24, 2012

After setting out to book a weekend in the Berkshires for President' Day, we stumbled upon The Kemble Inn after a friend recommended the recent NYTimes article on winter in the berkshires. Upon checking out the inn's website, we decided to give it a try over our other choices. We booked the Valentine's Day special which included one dinner plus a cheese plate and prosecco in our room upon arrival. These were all nice touches and the dinner surpassed all expectations we had of a dinner at our little inn. The breakfast included with the stay has a pretty vast menu and was perfectly cooked to order each morning. Most of the service provided over the weekend was by Paul and we could not believe how accomodating, helpful and nice he was and how much he handles around the inn! The service was amazing, the inn very quaint and pretty, and I can definitely appreciate the updates such as our room having a new bathroom. I can say I'm always hesitant to stay somewhere older for fear of it being dirty or rundown and this was not the case. In fact, we understand that there are more renovations on the way and this can only perfect this as the perfect inn for a weekend getaway. This is also a pefect location for trips to any sights and restaurants within Lenox and Stockbridge and not too far from Great Barrington. I hope to be back this Summer! Thank you!

My friends and I stayed at the Kemble Inn this fall to get away from the hustle and bustle of Fairfield county. We are a crazy loud group of realtors that sell over 70 million a year. The staff was very kind and offered the private dining room for our use to have conference calls and a place to set up our laptops. During cocktail hour we had several amazing bottles of wine (very impressive for a small inn) and watch the outstanding sunset off the back veranda. It was heaven. The rooms were decorated nicely. Breakfast was delicious! The coffee was perfect! Evan, a member of the staff was delightful and so helpful. We will be back as soon as we can find the time!

We recently stayed at the Harborside Inn for 3 nights whilst visiting Boston and I was personally disappointed with this hotel. It is rather impersonal, bedrooms are basic and we had a poor view but the position is great. It was so easy to get to from the airport, they provide free tea and coffee in the lobby and there are lots of places to eat close by - recommend Legal Foods but that's another review! It is a good base if visiting Boston but not for a romantic holiday.

'Great choice for first time trip to Boston'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 7, 2012

My husband and I stayed here for two nights on our first visit to Boston and found it to be a great place which suited our purpose exactly. Although they were doing some work in the entrance area, the staff were very pleasant and helpful (and apologetic for the work in progress) . I was worried that the noise of the work would affect our room but we were assured that it would not - and that they had given us a room on the 8th floor (top floor) anyway.

The wifi did not work at first but was swiftly repaired and followed by a call from the receptionist to make sure that all was well.

The room was pleasantly decorated and highlighted the original brick walls and merchant warehouse history of the building. The bed and pillows were comfortable, The windows actually open so that you can have fresh air and are not reliant only on the AC. The view along State Street to the State house in one direction and to the sea on the other was great.

My only minor complaints would be that the lighting in the room is very dim - would be nice to have just one more optional light overhead for dull days or evenings when you just need to see better!
It would also be nice to have the possibility of breakfast in the hotel - or at least a coffee maker in the room. However the 24 hour availability of coffee and tea in the lobby was good to have.

Next door there is a funny little breakfast/pizza place and very close by there are all sorts of other options for food throughout the day at Fanueil Marketplace. Also, Bostix kiosk is practically on the doorstep - great for half price "day of show" tickets, and the Hop on Hop off trolley tours start right across the road.

So, you can see that we thoroughly emjoyed our stay, would be happy to return, and would definately recommend this hotel to anyone!

My husband and I spent 2 nights at Harborside at the end of May, and we enjoyed our stay so very much. I had read reviews so knew pretty much what to expect. We had a 10-15 minute walk from Boston South Amtrak Station and the desk clerks were so helpful when we checked in early. Our room was ready for us. We had the queen atrium room which was fine with us. It was very comfortable and clean. I loved the exposed brick wall and the updated shower bathroom. Our tv worked great -- my husband loves sports. Also used the refrigerator in our room since there was a 24-hour shop on the block. The desk clerks answered our questions about the area and there was also a guest information book in our room with suggestions about breakfast cafes, diners, restaurants, etc since Harborside does not have an eating place. Location was my biggest reason to choose Harborside since it was right on the Freedom Trail and near Boston Harbor. We spent most of our time in the vicinity - walking from Boston Common to the USS Constitution and enjoying a sunset harbor cruise. Took desk clerk's recommendation the rainy morning we left and caught a taxi on Atlantic to get back to the Amtrak Station. I would recommend this hotel to all of my friends if they were going to that area of Boston.

We stayed at the Harborside at the start and end of our Cape Cod vacation. Easy to get to on the Blue Line from Logan, the Aquarium station elevator comes up right in front of the hotel entrance. The hotel's lobby is a work in process and still being renovated. Right now, it's a relatively large space (for a smallish hotel), but not particularly inviting - yet. Most of the rooms have no views, with the window facing an inner well (not really an atrium), so you want a view of downtown or the wharf, this isn't the place. A few rooms might front State Street. But the nice thing is that there is no street noise at all; it's really quiet in the rooms at night.

Most of the rooms are on the smaller size, with a queen bed though there are a few rooms with a king bed available - get one of those if you can. They told us no rooms with two beds. What we really liked was that the rooms, and especially the baths, had been remodeled and were very nice. We loved the large, walk-in tiled shower. So much nicer than the typical tub-shower with the lousy coutain found in most hotel rooms. The towels were big and thick - very nice.

Free Wi-Fi throughout. You won't find that in the large business chains! Coffee in the lobby 24 hours.

But the real plus is the location, right next door to the Custom House, a block from the Quincy Market, two blocks to the Haymarket, and across the road from the wharf. Our favorite Irish pub, the Black Rose, is almost across the street. The teriffic Sultan's Kitchen, is just a couple blocks up State Street. You can catch the T right in front and go anywhere in town. The North End, with all the great Italian restaurants, is a ten-minute walk.

So, yeah, if you want the big hotel with all the amenities, and the big price, by all means do that. But if you'd like a nice, boutique hotel with modern rooms and a great location, give the Harbor side a look.

Tip: We booked our room a few months in advance on Hotels.com and got a great rate!

I was so excited to be staying at teh Harborside Inn. The reviews had me excited to stay in Boston and so close to everything. I was very very very disappointed. We paid over $200 a night and I felt like I was in a budget hotel. The towels hanging in the bathroom were shredding and had hair all in them, the tv was very fuzzy and hard to watch anything. The floors creaked and not just cute old building creaking...creaking like the building could fall apart at any time. The bathroom was nice and upgraded and the bed was decently comfortable. There was an awful smell in the building, but that could be from the construction, kicking up all dirt and dust. The window were little peek-a-boo windows and the room was very very small. All of this would have been fine but the staff was absolutly horrible. The never greeted me or my husband when we came in or left. We needed to print off boarding passes and their computers didn't have Flash, so the guy behind the counter said he could help - he just needed our email and password. When we refused to give him that info, instead of offering the keyboard and allowing us to put in the information, he gave us tons of attitude and acted like he shouldn't be doing anything to help us. I never write reviews, but I was so disappointed in the quality of the hotel and the service I felt the need to let others know. I didn't expect a 5 star hotel, I didn't pay 500$ a night, but for almost $300 a night I felt like I should have had decent towels and quality customer service.

A month before my convention, all of the convention hotels were sold out except for the $500+ per night rooms...which I wasn't willing to pay. I took my family along (2 adults, 2 kids ages 1 and 3). I didn't want to stay 40-minutes away so, I did what I always do....searched for a good hotel in downtown Boston using TripAdvisor. Once again, we were quite pleased. The location is ideal. Easy walk to EVERYTHING....Aquarium, Museams, Quincey Market, North End (Little Italy), Marriott Longwharf across the street (for an awesome buffet breakfast), 24-hour convenience store next door, etc. etc.. It is only 10 steps from the (wheelchair accessible) exit/entrance of Aquarium subway station which means that it's 2 subway stops from Logan Airport and further destinations (or avoiding the rain) are easy, as well. The hotel itself is unique with it's original interior brick walls exposed. Our room was very nice...decor and bathroom great. The only things that could have been a bit better for us...(1) room carpet could have been a bit cleaner, (2) they do not offer cribs/pack-and-play, so we had to bring our own and (3) we were on the 8th floor and we could still hear some late-nighters outside at street-level until 3am. Otherwise, especially for the price in downtown Boston, the Harborside is a great place to stay.

We stayed at the Residence Inn for 3 weeks; my best advice is get a map from mbta.com, a 7-day link pass ($15) and explore! So many awesome things to see! I absolutely loved returning home from Boston on the ferry every night (covered by the link pass)  so relaxing sometimes I stayed on just for another round trip!

Location: I thought the location was great; right on the wharf with plenty of places to walk around. If you bring your dog (or kids) Paul Revere Park is on the other side of the bridge. The dogs ran around leash free and played, and there was a playground for the kids. If you exit the building through the back door by the gym, it is an easy and pleasant walk to North Station (subway), through the park and across the locks. Easy walk to the US Constitution, water taxi to Long Wharf and Beacon Hill monument. Taxi is $25-30 to hotel (tolls) and $15-20 return to Logan. If you aren't hauling too much luggage, you can take the subway to the North Station, or take the water taxi from Logan to Long Wharf and then the ferry from Long Wharf to Charlestown.

Sleep Quality: with the windows closed, the hotel was very quiet. The bed was comfortable, but the pillows were not (lumpy fiber fill). Great shades  kept most of the bridge light out.

Rooms: Smaller than a normal Residence Inn, and not updated with the new modern furniture. The rooms were fairly clean, but we had mold (both black and red) in the shower. I can see why; housekeeping didn't clean the tub area while we were there.

Dining: A great breakfast was offered every day, and the staff was wonderful. 'Dinner' was offered Mon  Thurs. I'm pretty picky and usually cooked in the room, so we only took advantage of salad items and cookies, although lots of residents ate there every night. There is a grocery store (Johnny's) in Charlestown  but even better  a produce/fish/cheese market Fri & Sat at Haymarket (orange or green lines), Trader Joe's at Copley (green line) and Whole Foods Bowdoin (blue line) and farmer's market in Dewey Square Park Tue & Thurs afternoons. All the restaurants around Charlestown are good (except the closest one, Max and Dylan's).

Amenities: Gym was small but nice, lobby was comfortable with leather chairs and a fireplace. Indoor pool and hot tub, but it looked like it really needed a good cleaning. Laundry was onsite and very clean.

Service: Was amazing. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful, as was valet. Restaurant staff was very professional and accommodating. The only problem we had was with housekeeping. It was kind of a joke, but after awhile it was very frustrating. We never knew when housekeeping would come, could be as early as 9:00 or as late as 4:30 which sometimes made it hard to plan my day. Also, cleaning and supplies were very inconsistent. Sometimes we would get washrags, other days not. Same thing went for dishwasher detergent, shampoo, kitchen towels, etc. We are fairly clean, so sometimes all they would do is make the bed  we ended up having to leave a mess to ensure our dishwasher would get started, or that soap dishes would be cleaned. The only thing gross (and this has been mentioned by other guests) was food that wasn't ours under the couch, the mold in the shower and the sheets for the foldout bed were put away un-cleaned and smelled strongly of men's aftershave. I left the sheets on the floor but clean ones were never put back. Housekeeping supervisor needs to do inspections.

'Great location, very friendly staff'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 9, 2012 NEW

We traveled there with the family and it was a great fit. Our daughter is 15 months old at the time of the trip so we wanted something central to be able to walk the freedom trail, the old Boston and go to the NE Aquarium. It was perfect for us. It is also next to the TD Garden, so it was only a short walk to go to the Celtics or grad a subway ride.

The staff was very helpful, smiling and made our trip a nice stay. You can't see everything in 10 days and this hotel will definitely be our choice for our next trip to Boston.

I used to live in Boston and now travel back for business. This hotel is not in such a great location, rooms back onto the Zakim bridge with lots of traffic and noise. Also there are no convenient T stops for public transportation - its about an 8 minute walk to North Station. Rooms are average. Staff friendly and helpful.

Stayed here to attend a Red Sox game on a Saturday night. I liked the location of this hotel, with a short walk to North Station and also to the ferry that takes you over to the aquarium. Nice wharf to walk out on and seemed to be in a pretty safe area. The breakfast was decent, included in the price and certainly plentiful. We ate breakfast outside overlooking the harbor so that was enjoyable. The lobby is pleasant and the staff are very accomodating and friendly. On the negative side, we came back from the baseball game around midnight and I searched all over for the remote control for the tv. (which was somehow missing from the room). This included looking under the bed, in the closets, inside the pull out couch. Through this search I found a dirty sock, gum wrapper, directions to the hotel (printed out two weeks ago) and enough dust to knit another sock, If I wanted a pair. I think, had the remote not been missing from the room, I probably wouldn't have found this treasure trove of left over stuff. Recommend that the hotel perhaps pick up the housekeeping a bit and double check rooms to make sure all the amenities (like the remote control) are in the room when doing up the room.

Convenient to the North End (Little Italy), The Garden and the U.S.S. Constitution, this Residence Inn occupies a lovely perfect spot in Charlestown, near Paul Revere Park. We were thrilled with the waterviews from our 8th floor suite; and caught a glimpse of the steeple of the North Church from the end of the hall. The lobby was welcoming; the lounge/breakfast room, quite nice; and the suites were spacious, clean and up-to-date. All in all, a very nice facility.

If you're driving, be aware: There is no on-site (free) parking, as with most Residence Inns; but valet is available for $35 per day. Cabs are readily available; but hoofing it isn't difficult, as many venues are within easy walking distance.

If you're going, be sure to grab a pie at Pizzeria Regina -- 11-1/2 Thacher St., best pizza in the North End -- and a cannoli from Bova's Bakery -- 134 Salem St. Both are easy walking distance and will make you all the more glad that you chose this hotel. I'm glad I did!

Given the incredibly high prices of decent hotels in Boston this is a lovely find. No, it isn't cheap but it delivers really high class accommodation at a price which doesn't bring the tears...and breakfast is included. On the route of the Freedom Trail in the beautiful Charlestown dock area it is a short walk from Boston Centre - or go by ferry - and only a $15 taxi ride from the airport.We had a one bedroom suite overlooking the bay and it was extremely well equipped and comfortable - dishwasher, microwave hob, tv in both loung and bedroom free wi-fi etc - honestly could not have wanted more. It is though of the Holiday Inn Express concept, ie doesn't have a restaurant etc but the breakfast was a full hot and cold buffet served in a comfortable spacious dining area. Why though do they let themselves down by using plastic plates and cutlery - so disappointing and cheap! The staff were excellent, helpfull and friendly. Would certainly recommend it.

My husband and I just returned from a long weekend in Boston and was so happy we found this hotel. It was our first trip to Boston and we can't wait to return. The location is wonderful, only a 30 minute walk to the N.E. Aquarium and less to many wonderful restaurants and historic sights. An easy 5 minute walk to the T at North Station/TD Garden. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The breakfast each morning was good, however crowed at times and hard to find a table. Our room was clean, spacious and comfortable. I will stay here again when I am lucky enough to return to Boston.

'The good and the not so good'

The location of the hotel is good...it is just over the Charles River and a very short walk to The Constitution, the ferry to Boston (which docks next to the Aquarium) and Bunker Hill. If you are not infirmed, you can walk over the bridge to Boston and walk the Freedom Trail in one day, very easily.

The room seemed a little small in comparison to other Residence Inn's we have stayed in. It was basically in the same configuration as the others; a kitchen and living area with a sofa bed, a separate bedroom and bathroom. The problem with the room was that we booked a Pure room which is to be allergin free and it cost quite a bit extra to book this type of room. The room seemed clean enough until I prepared for my shower the first evening. The shower curtain and the liner was covered in black mold. I decided I was not going to take a shower that evening and I'm glad that no one in my family is allergic to black mold. It was late and I didn't want to deal with housekeeping that evening so I decided to take my shower the next morning. I reported this to the front desk the next morning and they were apologetic and said that the curtain would be changed by the time we returned from our tour of The Constitution. Upon our return, the curtain appeared to have been washed, as it was wrinkled and still had black mold in the same location, but just not as much. I wonder - - for the amount we paid for that room for 4 nights, they easily could buy hundreds of new shower curtains. At least the liner had been changed out.

The bedroom had two queen sized beds, which were very comfortable. They were not hard as some hotel beds can be. But, with two beds, there really wasn't much room to walk and at one point I tripped on the bedskirt which was hanging down on the floor and found out that it was safety pinned to the bed as it previously had ripped the length of the bed. It was also filthy with random stains.

All-in-all, not what we paid for. The location was good, the breakfast was okay albiet crowded, the staff was friendly and prompt, but the Pure room was not up to standard.

We just spent four nights in Boston for sightseeing AND the Boston Marathon. This hotel has recently been refinished with new carpets, etc., and we thought it was new construction, because it was so clean.

Helpful, friendly staff. Nice breakfast selections with good amount of seating. It got a bit crowded with the marathon bunch in town, but it probably has plenty of seating for a normal week.

Hotel is just a couple of blocks from the USS Constitution (at dock) and directly on the "Freedom Trail". It is a short walk to the North Stop of the subway (the home of the Celtics and Bruins just above the subway, too).

Walked each evening into the Boston North End neighborhood for great restaurants. There are 75 Italian restaurants in that neighborhood!

'Good Hotel Outside of Downtown Boston'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2012 NEW

My two friends and I stayed at this hotel for a three night stay to watch a Red Sox baseball game. We chose this hotel because we wanted a larger room since there was three of us sharing one room. After reading the reviews we made the reservations and here are some additional information:

Shuttle from Airport: After collecting our bags at the airport I called the hotel for the shuttle and about 10 minutes later the shuttle arrived. For some reason, the hotel was not located on the free phone list at the airport baggage claim. Make sure you have the phone number handy.

Checking In: Checking in took about 10 minutes because there was several other guests checking in. The person checking us in did her job adequately, we had no complaints.

Room: The room is a typical Embassy Suites, there was a living room and a separate bedroom. There was also a dorm size refrigerator in the room. There was also a desk/table in the room. The room was perfect for myself and two other friends. Even though the hotel is near the airport, we did not hear any airplane noise.

Location: We did not walk around the hotel so I cannot say if there was anything (grocery store or restaurants) around the hotel. Dollar rent a car is right next door and there was also an office building but the area looked like an industrial area.
The subway (or "T" is what they call it in Boston) is about a 5-10 minute walk across this park. During the day, the walk is pleasant with people playing soccer or kids playing sports. At night, the park is lighted however it is pretty empty so some people might be spooked about this. The latest we walked across the park was about 10:30 pm and it was fine for us. If you did not want to walk across the park, I believe the hotel has a shuttle that will pick you up. The subway takes about 10-15 minutes to reach downtown Boston.

Checking Out: Checking out was quick and the shuttle back to the airport was uneventful. Just a warning, if you are flying United, make sure you know if you are flying to Newark, Houston, or Cleveland because United uses two separate terminals.

Overall we had no complaints about the hotel. Yes, there is a fee to use the internet, but oh well. We used this hotel because of the size of the room. If I was travelling with just another person, maybe we would have stayed someplace closer to downtown Boston, but then again the price might have been more than what we paid. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a bigger size room.

'typical airport hotel'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 8, 2012 NEW

This was a typical Embassy Suites hotel...although somewhat impersonal since it is an airport hotel. Unfortunately they do not have a "happy hour" experience here since the city of Boston does not allow them to give away cocktails or wine. They do, though, have the usual breakfast that is always good. The good part is that there is a subway station just a 5 minute walk away that takes you directly into Boston for just $2.00. The bad part is that the hotel is quite isolated, restaurant wise. It's basically in the middle of nowhere. We ended up eating at the Embassy Suites restaurant. Just adequate...they have a captive audience. For Hertz rental car users, it is extremely convenient. Right next door to their facility. Shuttle service to the terminals was very efficient. Very expensive stay since they doubled their usual rates due to graduation week.

I used this hotel twice once on arrival for two nights and once flying out the next day. It is good for the airport 5 minutes away and also the subway which is a short walk across the park and a $2 ticket gets you in to Boston 2 stops away. All the major car rental firms are within walking distance which was another reason we chose it.

The rooms are excellent a bedroom big bathroom and a lounge area. there is a pool which is small and a spa. Next door is a small gym.

The breakfast is excellent with fresh omelets on request, and is normally included in your room rate. Now the down side, the room rates I paid less for two nights than I did for one night on a sunday night. $360 for one night is frankly robbery. I had three night in Cape cod for less and got change! So think on if money isn't a problem It's a good place to stay fro airport and city access.

We stayed at the Embassy Suites at Logan airport for 3 nights post cruise before flying home. The hotel itself was your basic Embassy Suites with a large atrium for the bar/breakfast area. The service in the hotel was very good and we had a pleasant stay even though the weather did not cooperate. It rained heavily two out of the three days we were there. The location was very convienent for those of us having early flights. They have an airport shuttle every 10 minutes and the breakfast service starts at 5:30am which was great. It is a 5 minute or less drive to the airport from the front door of the hotel. Also all the flights are listed in their lobby so you can do a quick check to see if your flight is ontime even before you leave the hotel. There is a business area with free computers and printers. Overall a very nice stay (other than the weather)

The children even got a special coin from one of the porters. The selection for the buffet breakfast was quite extensive I was really surprised. It had a full service breakfast, it also included a healthy option of daily freash fruit. The pool area was great. The pool was 3 ft all around. This made it enjoy for my small children to swim in. We worried that being close to the airport we would hear the planes in the evening but this was not the case. There was a small fridge and microwave that were functional and helpful for the bedtime snack. I liked the location and it was within close proximity to all the places we wanted to visit.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It is small but I actually prefer boutique/smaller hotels.

PROS:
- The key thing I look for in a hotel is cleanliness with a modern decor, and this hotel certainly was very clean and had a modern feel.
- The hotel staff were really nice.
- There are free new release movies on TV, which is nice after a long day of exploring the city.
- Great location, just steps away from Newbury St, right across from the Boston Public Library (highly recommend the BPL tour by the way!)
- Price was amazing, I think we paid around $100CAD per night.

CONS:
- The breakfast did not have much selection, just bagels, some oatmeal, donuts....

Our group had a great week at the Charlesmark! The location right in the heart of Boston is ideal, we were steps away from great shopping and charming historic landmarks. The rooms were cozy, clean, and hip. The staff was courteous and very helpful - they extendes us every courtesy. The hotel was accommodating, helping us with a last minute cancellation on a sold out weekend. To top it all off they mixed a mean Manhattan! We will definitely stay at the Charlesmark next time we visit Boston.

'Boston "Pensione"'

My husband and I stayed at the Charlesmark during the perfect storm time period for getting a hotel room in Boston....Spring and multiple college and university graduations. We were in town for one such graduation. I picked the Charlesmark for location. It is in the perfect spot... Copley Square and just steps from the "Green line T" (Boston's mass transit system) If you are taking Amtrak into Boston it is also very close to the Back-bay Train station.
If you are driving there are a number of garages around the area, and the hotel has a limited discount at one a number of blocks away. I believe Boston is not a good car city, and it is easy enough to use public transportation or walking to get most everywhere. We had to bring a car because of moving our student's belongings.
The Hotel itself reminds me of a European pensone. It is small, and has limited services, but is lovely and easy. This is not the hotel to go to for over the top luxury/services. But the rooms are clean, and comfortable. I noticed in other reviews complaints about the size of the rooms. In my opinion the room was fine. I didn't have a view of any kind, but that is to be expected in this type of hotel. The building is an a very old part of Boston and once upon a time it was a residence. It is very quintessential Boston! (I used to live in Back bay many years ago) The bathrooms were clean and modern. I did find the provided soap etc. to be extremely basic. There is a 24 hour CVS (drug store) a block away for any forgotten toiletries. We bought soap that was more to our liking there.
The front desk staff was accommodating and helpful. The complementary breakfast (continental) was easy and adequate. The bar is lovely and active, but we had no issues with noise. I thought the price was good as well. I was renting a room during a high volume/high cost time period and this hotel was reasonable for the city. If you are looking for serious bargains motel like prices, you will need to go to the suburbs. Over all I would recommend this hotel.

'Great Overnight Stay'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 24, 2012

My wife and I stayed here last summer on the tail end of a road trip from NY through ME and MA. Reception was very pleasant and quick. Upon entering out room we were greeted by the sound of classical music playing lightly in the background, the room was clean and modern. Our room was small but comfortable, the bathroom was a nice size, kind of large considering the size of the rest of the room. The stereo was hooked up to speakers in the bathroom, which was a nice touch while showering and getting ready. The bed was comfortable and clean. I usually don't sleep directly on hotel pillows. I either bring my own pillow case or use a t-shirt. There were no worries here! Our view was of an alley between buildings, not very exciting but we weren't in town for the view from our room anyway.

The continental breakfast was basic but good. We did some adventuring around Boston but we never made it to the bar downstairs to try the drinks or food.

Parking in the area can be pricey but we found a great deal right down the street. Walking out of the Charlesmark, take a left and walk about 3 blocks (1-2 min) and there's a parking lot on the left.

Overall I was thrilled at the value here. Reasonable prices, great staff, great rooms and great location.

The location is fantastic. We bar hopped our way to Fenway park. The hotel is small and eclectic, very contemporary. It was clean and the rooms made the most of the space they had. Dan and Curt at the front desk were cheerful and helpful offering tips on bars as well as loaning a forgotten phone charger. Breakfast was very continental but was enough to break our fast. A great find for those willing to have fun with it.

'Modern & trendy but tiny bed!'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed May 21, 2012

After reading the reviews for this hotel we felt sure it was a good find. It is in a great location as mentioned in other reviews. It also lived up to the modern & trendy decor and vibe but I wasn't quite prepared for how small the rooms and bed in a standard room are! I don't really mind a small room but the bed was just ridiculous!!! It is definitely not what I would call a 'standard' double bed. When we asked to upgrade we were told that the Hotel was full and we couldn't be moved. We therefore had 2 uncomfortable nights sleep, disturbing each other everytime we moved!

The breakfast is ok, but don't expect much! A variety of bagels, fruit and doughnuts are served. A toaster would be a welcome addition.

In all, everything was good except for the bed size. If you book at this hotel I would suggest you pay a bit more for the Queen bed! We also liked the music system in the room but would rather have a good nights sleep.....so perhaps spend less on the sound system and give people a better bed!

My wife and I just returned from Boston where we stayed at the Charlesmark. Sadly I became sick shortly after arriving so I spent more time in the room then expected but this was the place to do it. While small the rooms were not cramped though I wouldn't want more then two people. There was an older style tv but it had surround sound, cable, and a DVD player. My wife enjoyed they free breakfast every morning so that helps. Also this is in a main area and right by the T so there is easy access to they city. The price was right, the location great, and a clean room with a helpful staff. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone coming to Boston

Stayed in a standard room which was compact but adequate for a single occupant. Very clean room and bathroom. They had copy of Boston Top 10 for guest use which was a nice touch. The only complaint about the room from me is that I could hear creaking noises (presumably from the occupant above) sometimes at night, otherwise a very quite room despite being on a busy road.

Breakfast which was included was bagels, porridge, fruit and beverages. There are two computers available for guest use. Check out is at noon which also helped.

The hotel is located right next to the Copley train station, close to lots of restaurants and shops and the Hynes Convention Centre is about a 10 min walk away. Walking distance to Boston Common too.

It is also great value compared to other hotels in the area. Highly recommend staying here when visiting Boston.

'Thanksgiving Weekend'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 13, 2012 NEW

My mother and I stayed at this property over Thanksgiving weekend in 2011. The front desk was courteous and professional. The location is excellent, close to sights and public transport. There was a bit of scaffolding over parts of the facade but it didn't affect my stay. Given the holiday weekend, it was pretty quiet, which I didn't mind.

We had a room with 2 queen beds on a low floor. It reflected the rest of the hotel: although once grand, it was aging and showed it. That isn't to say that the beds and bathroom weren't clean - they were spotless. But the furniture, fixtures, and paint touch ups betrayed their age. It's not that I wanted modernity - the decor is befitting and I like the look of another time. It's just that when you look at things up close, a stale mustiness comes to mind. That was certainly the case of the closet. While rather large (a small walk-in) management decided not to upgrade it in terms of a paint job. The color of the interior of that closet did not match the attempt at freshness of the rest of the room and it looked a bit depressing. The view out the window wasn't much either, but I didn't mind that so much.

The bathroom amenities were good and I especially liked the rose-smelling lotion. I almost never use hotel lotion but this one was excellent. There's also a heat lamp in the ceiling so when you get out of the bath or shower, you can enjoy toasty (but noisy) warmth while drying off.

The Oak Room is gorgeous, of a different time like the rest of the hotel. The breakfasts we had were luxurious and indulgent. The potatoes that came with everything were the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. Crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. I suspect they were parboiled and had absorbed a lot of oil in the cooking but not greasy although plenty of calories, I'm sure. The fruit platter was arranged a bit oddly  the morning cook must have been having fun or keeping from boredom by creating an odd architectural piece with cut fruit. The hot chocolate was a disappointment  while I believe it was made with steamed milk (a good thing) it was clear they'd used powder (Nestle or something like that).

We also had Thanksgiving dinner in the Oak Room. The place was lively, although the buffet area felt odd with stations so far from each other. I didn't even see the hot cider until as I was leaving. The room was dimly lit and the cider station was placed so close by the door that I completely missed it when walking in. The food was quite good. The turkey was delicious as were all the trimmings. There was a bit of confusion with the server at the start when he had to actually come find me as I was at the buffet to take our entre order, but it was smoothed out and service was fine for the rest of the evening. The wait staff, from what I saw, is mostly men whom I suspect have been doing this for a long time. I've seen better buffet spreads (Lacroix at the Rittenhouse Hotel is amazing) but this one was quite good and I was very happy with the raw bar. What was a disappointment, however, were the stale desserts. If they were made on premise, then they should find a different pastry chef. I suspect, though, that the desserts were bought elsewhere. The small raspberry cakes had horrible oily pink frosting. The sponge cake itself was dry and chewy. The mini blueberry crumble pie was stale and the filling gummy. The only good thing was the banana cream pie, however, what little I got to taste of it was scraped from the mess diners had made of it. I went back a couple of times more to see if the hotel staff had refreshed the desserts and put more of the banana cream pie out but they hadn't. I wish they'd attended that station better.

All in all, a pleasant stay. The hotel lobby is gorgeous. The Christmas tree and the other decorations that were put up while we were out were lovely and in appropriate taste to the rest of the hotel. Another great touch is having Catie, a beautiful black lab, in the lobby. Although the dog house is stationed by the door, I only got to see her once the whole weekend, probably because she was busy accompanying guests on their walks. That's such a great amenity, to be able to go for a walk or run with a beautiful dog. Despite the poor desserts, I enjoyed Thanksgiving dinner in the Oak Room and was glad for the experience.

'They put the "Fair" in the Boston Fairmont'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 13, 2012 NEW

Perhaps it was just the day we were there. But, while a gorgeous hotel to look at inside and out, there were lapses in the service that I expect from this upper class hotel and I'll look somewhere else next time in Boston. The desk staff were quick to be of service but we had no help with luggage until inside the lobby. The "gold" service floor has a very nice lounge area with evening snacks and breakfast but minimal service and not a friendly hello to be found. I enjoy the wide and quiet hallways and the spaciousness of the rooms but some functionality was lacking (nowhere to lay out bathroom items around the sink). Too bad.

'Classic spot, uneven execution'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 12, 2012 NEW

We just completed a stay at the Fairmont Copley Plaza. It was our first visit to the hotel, but we are frequent visitors to Boston. Sitting here now, I don't think I'd return.

Copley Square is, in my opinion, the best place to stay in the City. Central to everything. The hotel is classic, and beautiful. In spite of the renovation, the rooms still feel old, with thick old coats of paint and bad lighting. But the room we had was huge, as was the bathroom. There was virtually no furniture, though, so both seemed empty.

The main issue is housekeeping. There was an old M&M on the floor by the TV, so I have to question the vacuuming. Our ice bucket was taken and not returned. I had to ask twice over 2 days to actually get one brought to the room. And when we called to get fresh towels brought in and the wet, used one removed, the front desk obliged, and then housekeeping called to argue over whether we actually needed them.

The maitre'd at breakfast was great. Very polished, very professional. Unfortunately, he wasn't at his station when we arrived, and we were sent to a table with a curt finger-point. And that's emblematic of this hotel. Sometimes sublime, too-often careless and off-hand and dismissive.

For the price we paid, we hoped to be pampered a little. We didn't expect to have to plead a case for towels. This hotel needs to decide what it wants to be.

'Not my first choice'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 11, 2012 NEW

I have not been back since 10 years ago. Came back again for business and was booked at this hotel again by my company. The room has been beautifully appointed, even though it's on the small size, but adequate. However, as I mentioned in my last review on this hotel, the wall is still thin and voice travels from hallway and next door (my room, 532, was right next to the service elevator, so I could hear the bell ringing every time it stopped on my floor). And the water pressure is still weak (my colleague describes it as "old-man peeing"). This is all due to the age of the building, so I don't think it will be changed. And that's the reason I would not pick this hotel if I have a choice.

One big plus is their newly added fitness centre. Not the biggest, but has every equipment needed, in a very open, bright space.

Service-wise, I find it hit-and-miss. Some I find are truly friendly and willing to go above and beyond. Some are just going through the motion, saying all the right things, but action and attitude do not match.

Truly exceptional service. Even the porters are perfect. This kind of training isn't accidental -- they must work at it. Also loved the location, of course -- great view of Copley Square and walking distance to everything. Public rooms are stunning. Very nice cafe bar with great food. Super room service. Nice touch -- nothing to sign on the room service delivery; the receipt is in a small envelope. Only complaints were minor -- couldn't make steamed milk for a room service latte (they only had one machine & it was on the fritz); not enough water pressure for the big showerhead to work well. But overall very enjoyable & a good value too.

We have stayed in the Copley Plaza many times, even before it was a fairmont. But clearly the best stays at the Copley Plaza have been during the Fairmont years. The lobby is lush with its hih ceilings the grand entrance hall from st james ave. and the decor on the gold floor is warm and luxurious, but not in your face as the lobby may seem to a first time Copley guest. The room has a beautiful chandelier and comfy beds, not to mention the great all marble bathroom. The room has a huge window overlooking the square with a large sit-in window sill. The Oak Room downstairs has delicious steak and a classical ambiance. The service of the whole hotel is unparalleled. They even set up my son's stuffed animals on the bed. The private gold floor check in was speedy and our bags arrived within five minutes. The maid even left us a Christmas card on the nigh of Christmas Eve (turndown is also complimentary :)). The Copley Plaza is a must stay in Boston.

'Pleasant, charming and comfortable stay, great location in Boston.'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2012 NEW

I recently stayed at The Fairmont Copley Plaza for a conference and while I initially heard the hotel was undergoing some renovations, it looks as if they are in the very final stages. The hotel is charming, something that you don't always get today with many of the cookie-cutter chain hotels. This is a historic building, originally opened in 1912. However, the recent renovations have restored the building and brought the interior to more modern standards. The room was luxurious with a very comfortable bed, new furnishings, fixtures, carpeting and a large flat screen and a solid, functional work desk. The bathroom is beautifully done in marble with a wonderful rainfall shower head (amazing, going to buy one for home!) The high end soaps and shampoo provided were such a surprise. They smelled amazing. I wish the hotel shop sold these or that they could be obtainable from the retailer, but it looks like they're specifically made for the hotel only. The restaurant and room service both delivered excellent quality and well prepared food. Room service was served punctually and temperature appropriate. Nothing left to desire as far as food in my opinion, but food is very different for everyone, of course. The renovation has definitely transformed this hotel although I did notice some areas like doors and door frames, for example, that were a little rough around the edges. It looked like the work was done, but some of the finishes just looked a little odd, as if they were not a part of the renovation plan or just done with poor craftsmanship or as a result of cost cutting. I found it odd that not everything would be completely finished after a renovation of this scale. Also, speaking of doors, they are loud, and noise from hallway traffic and conversations and door slamming at night was a little annoying while trying to relax. This certainly isn't an issue unique to this hotel but maybe the doors could have been constructed differently so they do not have to be slammed. Nonetheless, this is an excellent grand hotel with friendly and attentive staff and I would not hesitate to return if in Boston for business or pleasure. Oh, and be sure to spend a little time with Catie Copley. I've never stayed in a hotel with a resident canine, so this was unique and special!

My wife liked the breakfast in the club level lounge.

One complaint: the carpets would benefit from daily vacuuming. My room was not vacuumed during my three-night stay. The remodeling that is being performed left quite a mess in some of the hallways, and I cannot understand why there no one vacuumed after the workers left for the day.

Overall, a beautiful hotel with almost-excellet service. A new frequent-vacuuming policy, and it will be perfect.

Stayed at the Fairmont Copley for a conference in 2008 and was disappointed in the shabby condition of the rooms. This and the odd bites on my feet and ankles had me convinced that I would never return. Glad to say, the latest renovation has breathed new life into the historic hotel. The drab, dirty and dreary carpet and furnishings now sparkle with a nouveau Cape Cod style with soft tones of silver and gray. A vast improvement.

It is important to note that the Oak Bar is still under renovation and the temporary bar in the St. James restaurant is fairly inadequate. The Gold floor lounge is nice, but isn't always well-stocked for breakfast or evening hors d'ouevres. The service there was outstanding, however, thanks to Aja, one of the supervisors at the desk. She helped make this stay a memorable one. In terms of Catie Copley, the canine ambassador, it may be time for her to retire. At 10 years old, she looks a bit too weary and deserves time off.

All in all, a repeat visit is warranted. Copley Plaza is a great location with easy access to all the major sights. The hop-on, hop-off trolley with the harbor cruise is a great way to see Boston whether it's your first time there or not. And nearby is Legal Seafood, a place where the fresh seafood and sangria are simply sublime.

We were attracted by the JFK links and the hotel's amazing history - also it wasn't too expensive! This is a great location for dowtown Boston, only about five minutes walk to Quincy Market and a few minutes from Boston Common. The best thing about the hotel is the atmosphere. The lobby is fantastic and the restaurant, though a little expensive, has an elegant charm. Our room was a little dark, but very quiet. The bathroom was a little small.
Overall, a very good hotel with helpful staff and very good value if you get a deal.

'The Best in Boston'

The Omni Parker House was a fabulous hotel. The lobby was beautiful. It is a historic landmark hotel. The staff at the Parker House were great! All of the concierges were so helpful, making dinner reservations, making recommendations for breakfast places, and giving directions. The room was beautiful. We had a corner room which had windows on two different walls. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were very high quality. The room was very spacious with lovely furniture. The bathroom was very spacious and well lighted.
The location of this hotel was perfect. Walk out to the right a few blocks and one would be at Fanueil Hall and Quincy Market, and the onto the North End. Walk out of the hotel to the left a few blocks and one would be at the Boston Commons, and Beacon Hill. The restaurant was very good and priced within a normal range for breakfast. The service at the restaurant was excellent.

This was a fabulous hotel to stay at in Boston..

We stay here once a year and I think the Omni Parker House might the reason we return to Boston. The rooms are great, the staff is helpful and you can't beat the perks of the Omni Guest Rewards program.

We had a couple of drinks in the bar and it was a fun place to wind down the evening. We also got breakfast from room service. And it arrived on time and was pretty good and not a bad value.

Once again a great stay at the Omni Parker House.

I had a great stay here! I have to say the people of Boston are very friendly and the staff here are no exception. Everyone was extremely helpful from the front desk to the gift shop. I got 4 star service my entire stay! I thought the hotel was incredibly interesting and even wound up buying a history on the hotel in their gift shop. This location is part of the freedom trail! I found the location to be very convenient. I was here for work and only had a couple hours to see Boston one of the days but thanks to its location I was able to do just that! I would love to stay again!

We find this assessment of our hotel somewhat odd considering that our guestrooms were recently renovated and feature new HD televisions, Wifi service and more. It's true that we are an historic property with some smaller rooms, but many guests report finding these qualities add to our charm. We do apologize for not delivering the Select Guest benefits appropriately and acknowledge that this unfortunate circumstance undoubtedly clouded this guest's experience of their most recent stay with us.

'Fantastic Hotel'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2012 NEW

We were very fortunate to stay at the Omni Park House hotel for two nights as part of an organised tour. We were fascinated to learn about this historic hotel which is centrally located to amenities and attractions. It is a short walk to Beacon Hill, Boston Common and is located on the Freedom Trail and close to the T-line subway system. The lobby, restaurant and bar areas are all decorated in dark wood panelling and there are wonderful themed flower arrangements which are changed every two days. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and are only too happy to help and answer questions. Our room was very spacious as was the bathroom, however, our fellow travellers seem to say their bathrooms were quite small. The service in the dining room is excellent and we ate very well at breakfast. The chef in there cooks a brilliant omelette! We fell in love with Boston and want to return in the near future to spend more time there and will have no hesitation in staying at the Omni Parker House again. We can highly recommend.

'Omni Parker House: Old and tired, but that may be its charm'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 9, 2012 NEW

person found this review helpful

It's like a visit to my long deceased grandparents' home (I have mixed memories about the time I had to spend at my grandparents' home...).
North America's oldest hotel is certainly that: old. The furniture is old and stuffy, the toiletries very "traditional", the window treatments somewhat smudgy - all in all it's ,more like the housing facility of a fancy gentlemen's club than in a commercial hotel. I was reminded of an anecdote about the Claridge in London - upon complaints by a Texan billionaire that the furniture was all worn out in his suite, a staff member replied to him: "yes, but they were worn out BY ROYALTY."
The only real complaints: The shoe shining service did not work, and there was only one light plug in the living room of the 2 room suite I stayed in, forcing me to use my cell phone light to search for the light switch when I got up in the middle of the night.
The staff was nice and helpful, cannot comment on housekeeping as i spent only one night.
Not my first choice, but quite all right, and in all its stuffiness quite charming.

'Grand Old Hotel with style'

This is the oldest continuously runing hotel in the US and it is beautiful. The old wood carvings and gilted interior is really beautiful and the accommodations are very nice. One of my pet peeves was alleviated as they not only 'say' they are environmentally conscious about washing linens, that practice their posted policies. I was pleased with the service and amenities and enjoyed my stay. It's in the heart of a bustling city center, walking distance to many fun things to do.

'Perfect central hotel  with winds of colonial style and stars from stage and screen'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 7, 2012

The family spent Memorial weekend (May 25th- May 28th, 2012) in Boston for the first time and we stayed at Omni Parker House in central Boston which was great.
The feeling inside is of an old British colonial style hotel with dark wooden panels on the walls and I love it, and we will definitely come back next time we visit Boston, maybe together with our little puppy since pets under 25lbs. are allowed.
PS. See also my note at the end.DS.

Staff is very attentive, friendly and provides excellent service. Both check-in and check-out went quick and the bill was correct with breakfast and bar tabs that we've put on our room. On the 3rd floor we had a quiet deluxe room and slept like queens in it. It was also with a sofa group so we could all (family of four) gather around it for different evening activities like playing a game of 'Clue'. It was actually like a small living room. Included was also a $15 Food and Beverage credit per stay, which we used. If we would have joined their Guest Loyalty program before we got there we could have had complementary wireless internet.

The hotel is located in the heart of Boston close to the theater district, shopping area (Quincy Market, and Faneuil Hall marketplace), The New England Aquarium, restaurants (don't miss a lobster for dinner!), rapid transit station, the start of the Freedom Trail (we walked half of it and ended up in the Italian District for a fabulous dinner) and it has been the place for stars of stage and screen since the 19th Century, who also could enjoy the hotel's famous Boston cream pie, which is extra ordinary to-die-for delicacy!

We had a Park n Stay Package which made it easy to leave our car at the valet parking, since we walked to all of the spots we wanted to see and if it was a little too long to walk we took the underground trolley transit which was very easy and convenient. We used it to get to The Fenway Park (USA's oldest baseball arena) and Museum of Fine Arts. No need for the car during our stay even if our package included unlimited in/out privileges. There was also a complimentary extended checkout for the vehicle that are past 1 pm, which we didn't needed to use.

NOTE! NOTE! The hotel is located on 60 School Street, but be aware that there are 7 different 'School Streets' in Boston so pick the correct one! Our GPS took us to one of the wrong ones and we had to ask our way to find the correct address and that added and extra hour in driving time to the already 6 hours from Philadelphia.

'Small but comfortable rooms'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 13, 2012 NEW

It's a reasonably priced boutique hotel in a quiet residential neighborhood. If you don't want to spend the bucks necessary for a chain hotel in pricy Boston, this is a nice alternative. It's within 2 easy blocks of the Back Bay T station on the orange line, so all of Boston is easily accessible. The 2 twin beds were comfortable, and the small bathroom was chic and functional. Water pressure in the shower was good. We stayed in early June and the individual AC unit in the room did a fine job. There's good free coffee from the Flavia machine in the lobby 24/7, so no in-room coffee/tea was not a problem. The staff was super friendly and pointed us to the diner and upscale coffee shop around the corner. The only issue might have been the bar in the lobby that was very loud until late at night on our first night, a Sunday. It was quiet on a Monday night. If that's a concern, ask for an upper floor room in this 8 floor converted apartment building.

'Chandler Inn - You Might Want to Avoid It'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed June 12, 2012 NEW

Disappointing hotel. Rooms are tiny, and bath room is even smaller. Only had enough floor space to open one suitcase, had to clear off a night table to open a second suitcase. Parking (self parking only) is a few city blocks away in a public garage. We were notified during our stay (and was well posted throughout the building and elevators) that power would be shut off from 10:00 AM to 12:00 AM during our stay. Since checkout time is 11:00 AM, there was no info on whether we had to checkout before, or if it would be extended. So we planned on checking out before. At 8:30 AM we received a call from the front desk advising that there was a change, and power would go out at 9:00 AM. So we rushed to packed our bags and get out. We got to the elevator at 8:53 AM, and found the power to them was already shut off. Inconceivable. So our luggage (two suitcases and two overnight bags) had to be carried down from the 5th floor to the lobby via the stairs. This was a planned extension to our trip to Boston as part of my daughters wedding. It was a disappointing end to what was a great week otherwise.

Stayed three nights for college graduation and will go back next time I'm in Boston for any reason. The rooms are 'cozy' much like a European boutique hotel. Very clean, modern amenities, and convenient to the Back Bay T station. Being in a neighborhood, rather than a commercial area, you have more of a 'homey' feeling. Above all, the staff is as good as it gets. They were informative, helpful, accommodating, and as friendly as can be. A wonderful experience.

Think small but cozy. That's what I found at the Chandler Inn. Reasonably affordable for Boston and near the Back Bay T. The location is pleasant -- the hotel is surrounded by brownstones, and there are good restaurants within walking distance both directions on Berkeley Street (the major cross street). Friendly and helpful staff. Comfortable bed and compact but clean and modern bathroom. A good find.

'Good value, great location'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 2, 2012

Stayed 4 nights with family and friends during Harvard commencement week, when prices around town were sky high. We weren't looking for hotel amenities, just affordable rates, clean rooms, a convenient location. The Chandler Inn met our needs. Rooms and bathrooms are small, but functional; think modern European boutique with Ikea-type furniture. No closet for clothes; instead you get a stylish stainless steel rack on one of the walls. The bedstands have drawers and some rooms have a desk with additional storage space. Air conditioning is remote controlled and, once turned on, removes what another reviewer called a "musty smell" from the room. Ample good quality soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion that are replenished daily. Friendly reception staff. Free wifi.

For breakfast you're likely to be referred to Billy's around the corner on Berkeley Street; it's a local hangout that serves huge American-diner meals. If you want more 'refined' food, the Berkeley Street Cafe next door has excellent pastries, coffees and teas. A slightly longer walk west on Tremont Street offers a multitude of cafes, bars, restaurants, for all tastes and in all price ranges. The area is gentrified, trendy, with a Whole Foods/farmers' market ambiance. Farther down on Washington and Shawmut Streets is a Latin-American/Caribbean enclave, with ethnic offerings. Actually, Noche, a really good Latin-themed restaurant/bar, is just a block away from the hotel on Appleton Street.

One caution: the bar next door to the Inn's entrance - it shares the restrooms - is a fairly genteel
gay watering hole, but we did see two men openly making out at 6pm on the street corner, which
was a bit upsetting to my elderly parent. Please note that the men's conduct would have been inappropriate for the location even if they had been a heterosexual couple.

The Inn is going to be opening another hotel across the street, with suites and larger rooms. I would stay there, if the prices are in the same range as rhey are now, although the Inn itself is entirely acceptable, given its modest ambitions.

'If you can afford more, pay it in a better hotel!'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 1, 2012

Boston is expensive and, when I asked Reception if they had a bigger room as ours was small, that is basically what they said - small rooms, high prices. But four nights here was too much money and not enough space. I'd booked and paid ahead and would have moved after one night if I hadn't paid ahead. Not so much because of the cost or space but because the sheets must have been through the laundry so many times, they were thin and 'bobbly' to the extent I found it hard to believe they were cotton. Definitely not for the 'next to the skin'! The room was clean. The staff were fine. There is a bar below, but it wasn't noisy. The location is convenient. The area is 'safe'. But the sheets............and that is something they could have done something about for very little money.

'Clean, good location and price, but I won't stay here again.'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed May 31, 2012

So I stayed at the Chandler Inn over Memorial weekend after reading reviews on trip advisor and finding a decent deal online. I was concerned about some of the reviews I read but decided to book it because of the price and location, and that's about what I got. The room was clean and the front desk was very friendly and did a great job of providing customer service.

Although I was not expecting a 5 star hotel, I was very dissapointed to find that the room I got (806) had a musky/humid smell and the mattress was in pretty bad shape. The smell would go away while the AC was on, but it would be back the next day after being out of the room during the day. The mattress wasn't damaged or dirty, it just felt old and out of shape. It was not very comfortable. I wouldn't stay here again mostly because of the mattress. I was in pain after the second night.

To be fair, I didn't complain or ask the front desk to change it, mostly because I spent very little time in the room. However, this is a deal breaker for me and I will stay elsewhere next time.

The Back Bay T station is 2 blocks away, and lots of restaurants and shopping areas are within 5 minute walk, so the location is excellent.

We stayed in this nicely located hotel in Downtown Boston with our two young sons. The hotel is clean and the staff is very friendly. Parking is on site for a fee. The rooms are nothing to write about. Very simple furnishings and decor. Modest spaces, but we weren't planning to spend much time there except to sleep anyway. The hotel is walking distance to several Boston attractions including the Prudential Center, the Boston Common and Fenway Park. The place is quite pricey, but most of the downtown hotels are.

After spending $1,300.00 at this facility for a 3 day stay, they nickeled and dimed us with a 123.00 charge for self-service parking. The room was nothing special even though the first room we checked into had a wet vomit saturated rug between the double beds. Our breakfast at the lobby cafe was exciting. The vendor made my wife a hazel nut capacuno that was served in a large to go cup. It was 3/4 foam and 1/4 coffee. When my wife went to complain, she was told that was how they came out of the machine and that she would have to purchase a new beverage if she wanted more. Not customer friendly.
The Bell Hops were the highlight of this stay. They were most helpful and a delight to deal with.

We stayed in Boston with the kids after a college reunion and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The hotel location is superb; it is not on a very busy street, but very convenient to numerous sites and shopping. A friend of mine mapped out a walk down Mass Ave to the Esplanade along the Charles, to Charles Street down to the Public Garden, then back down Commonwealth Avenue. Beautiful. We walked 10 minutes to a Redsox game, whereas the rest of the population is taking multiple forms of transportion and spending hours to get there. Newberry Street, with all of its shops and restaurants is a few blocks away. We would definitely stay again. Our room was large enough to accommodate an additional rollaway bed. I thought the room size was perfectly adequate, especially compared to a typical Manhattan hotel. The T stops are convenient as well for trips to the North End, Cambridge, etc. Excellent!

As we were smiling away she didn't shoot a smile but was like "I was suppose to go but here I am at work" so we responded with "ya it must be hard working on holidays its memorial day and all official kick off to summer!" and what came out of her mouth was just shocking and we couldn't stop talking about it she said "I hate America i'm not from here I don't care about this country or their holidays, its like christmas I don't celebrate it who cares and we are a hotel open 365 days a year 24 hours a day" me and my friend were like UMM OKAY? We are both Canadians and were still irked by this. She just handed us our keys still no smile and that was that. The elevators were quick our room was easy to find it was spacious and clean the beds were very comfy as always at the Hilton. The view was nice it was of the city we were on the 15th floor. Location was PERFECT!!!!! About 3 blocks away from Newberry Street and 4 blocks from Fenway park very convenient and cabs are always lined up outside which was nice. Parking is 41$ per night extra so keep that in mind. There is a Starbucks which was great for a morning coffee and bite to eat it's located right beside the complimentary business center. Overall I would stay here again cause of the location and the rooms and hopefully next time I won't get such a odd check in experience.

We found this hotel most comfortable - wonderful bed. Restaurant attached to hotel was super - best lobster roll - reasonable prices - good breakfast buffet. Only negative was no free wifi in room. Since we were not on expense account, we found the $14.95 per day too high!

I stayed here over a very busy weekend with a million college graduations in the area, so things were pretty busy. As everyone has mentioned the location is great, within walking distance of everything. The staff was friendly and helpful. Accidentally parking got put on my room, and they kindly took it off for me. Would stay here again.

Downsides: I wasn't overly impressed with the property. The lobby areas were small and so so, and the room was clean but very small, the bathroom was miniscule. I couldn't figure out how to work the A/C in the room, which is a bit ridiculous considering I stay in hotels every other week. Lastly, the breakfast was only average.

Price was very steep, but, you will pay a fortune to stay almost anywhere downtown, so I wouldn't say it was any more expensive than anywhere else.

'Great place to stay for shopping in Boston'

Booked a reward night at Hilton Back Bay for the St. Patrick's Day weekend. Was worrying about the blackout in Back Bay just two nights prior to my arrival but everything turned out to be fine.

The location can't be better for those who fancy some weekend shopping - 10 minute walk from Back Bay Station and a couple of blocks away from the Prudential Center shopping mall and the bustling Boylston Street.

My room was spacious and nicely sun-lit with all the comfort and amenities you could expect from a Hilton. The indoor pool was another nice feature that I took advantage of before taking the 11:00am train back to New York. Flawless in every way.

Ive stayed at the Liberty several times and each time is better than the next. They greet you with a complimentary glass of champagne,yes please, they already make you feel like a VIP! The staff is so nice and pleasant,they are very accommodating with all requests! The hotel is somewhat new and very modern. The restaurants are also very good, Clink is exceptional and Alibi is a great bar to just grab a drink or two. Even the lobby itself is great to grab a drink and they also have a special bar for hotel guests only,this is ALWAYS one of my first reccomendations of where to stay in Boston and usually mine when I want a staycation or for a fun event!

The room had 2 comfy double beds, with stocked fridge of drinks and snacks very pricey tho, the bathroom was my favorite separet shower and deep tub, loved the design sliding door, comfy robes and slippers provided.

I liked this hotel alot. It was really cool how it was once a jail, now it is an upscale, modern hotel. The lobby is amazing with it's high ceilings and great woodwork. Our room was a good size room up on the 12th floor, although the only view we had was off Boston MGH Ear and Eye Infirmary. The beds were clean and comfortable and the bathroom was really nice. It had a separate shower and bath, along with a large sink and several mirrors. This hotel was steps away from the red line T stop which was convenient. It was also within walking distance of the Charles River, Beacon Hill neighborhood and the Boston Common. There were a few nice looking restaurants and bars in the hotel, but we did not try them. Overall, this was a great stay and I would definitely come back.

Staying here was a great experience. The hotel was a renovated former prison with vaulted ceilings and even former cells as rooms. We stayed in the new tower. The rooms were very well appointed if a little small. We had a terrific view of the Charles River and some of the City. They allowed us to bring our dog and he was treated like a visiting Prince.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights over the long Memorial Day weekend. The hotel was WONDERFUL (besides Scampo but that's another story). From the front desk to the the cleaning staff, everyone was spot on their game. I must say though, my wife and I are only 27 and we were asked a few times if we were guests at the hotel. Perhaps we don't fit the mold of the typical Liberty Hotel guest. Nevertheless, it was an unbelievable weekend and the Liberty Hotel has set the bar high for us.

While traveling with Sell This House Extreme, in Boston, we stayed at the Liberty Hotel in Downtown. It might not be my first choice to stay with family and kids, but I sure am having a good time! The restaurants on the bottom floor and on the top floor have great food, good service, and the entire front lobby turns into a multi-level night club, or trendy scene with a cool vibe, good looking people ready to have a great time. The rooms are fairly quiet, with the exception of late night stragglers not yet ready to end their night. Once an infamous prison, remnants are apparent in the design with the exposed brick and iron bars. You can clearly see the layout of the cells, and can't help but imagine what it was like years ago when the prison was in full function. Kind of erie, if you think about it, but they've done a great job of turning it into a cool hip place to stay!

Things I like most:
* I love the free coffee station they have every morning at the bottom of the elevators
* The cool hip vibe of the front lobby
* The bouncers at the front door are really great and have fun personalities
* The service at the valet is great
* The front desk staff is great!
* Love the beds in the room
* Lots of counter space in the bathroom
* Bath tubs are new, deep, and clean
* Beautiful glass shower - sexy design

Things I disliked:
* The bar menu in the bottom left restaurant should have have a few more healthy choices
* They have a program where if you choose NOT to have your room cleaned, you get a 5$ coupon for the hotel. I have been here for two weeks, had my room cleaned twice and was only given ONE coupon. No big deal to me, but if you're offering the program, it should be done right.
* As with many hotels, there should be easier outlets in the room to access to charge phones etc....
*Noise can be an issue in the hallways outside the rooms on some nights so if you need rest .....

'Nice hotel, poor reception service'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 7, 2012 via mobile

I stayed in the hotel for 4 nights. Wonderful hotel and agree with it is interesting, incorporating the jailhouse elements.
I was one alone with one luggage and one huge luggage. I had problems with my room card(both of them) when I checked in at 8pm. I lugged all my luggages down to the reception and they got another guy to attend to me. Accompanied me up with a new set of cards which doesn't work again. All these without any of them offering to help me with my luggage! I would expect me for a hotel of this stature. There were also some problems with me looking for the item I purchased. Looking from bell boy to reception and to the room and to reception again. Clearly not communicating....

The pleasant experience I had was the bellboy -mike who helped me purchased A personal item. He got it done by the night and I would like to commend him on this!

I wouldn't return as it is too far from down town. Fyi. I was on biz trip.

The bathroom was stunning though, very large with a shower and soaker tub. I would stay here again.

'Not Your Typical Hotel'

My wife and I stayed at the Club Quarters for a couple of nights while attending our son's college graduation. While I booked months in advance, this was the only hotel in the downtown Boston area where I could get a room for under $300 that weekend... in fact, it was under $200.

This is a really nice place, but you must accept the fact that it is not a typical hotel. When they say "Club" Quarters, they aren't getting. Companies can join and get special rates, and if your company is a member, you can get even better rates on weekends. They also have branches in NYC, Washington, London, and elsewhere. If you are a business traveler staying by yourself, this would be a fabulous place to stay even if your company isn't a member But, the rooms are small... everything is reduced in size; the room, the bed, the bathroom, etc. The bed, for example, is a full size bed... not even a queen. If you're traveling by yourself this would not be an issue, but traveling as a couple, the whole room got a bit tight. But everything was clean and completely up to date.... even a flat screen television, though, like everything else, it was small.

I loved the way they set up the amenities. Need an extra pillow... or an ironing board... or whatever? No need to call housekeeping... there's a closet on each floor that has this stuff and you just help yourself. Want some fresh drinking water? There's a water dispenser in the hall with bottles available... so you can make your own bottled water for free. Downstairs, the lobby is also tiny, but there is a "club room." TV, reading materials, coffee all the time... it's a really nice place. The coffeemaker is one of those Keurig machines so it only makes 1-2 cups at a time... no problem with it sitting around getting burned all day. Other amenities are available too... they even have iPad's available for loan, for example. There are computers downstairs in case you need them and one is reserved solely for printing boarding passes during certain periods.

There is a bar/restaurant connected to the lobby on the first floor. It's a nice place, but stay away from it on Saturday nights unless you like loud Karaoke.... I mean really loud. No noise filtered up to our room, but if you are looking for someplace to have a quiet nightcap, this is not it.... at least not on Saturdays. By Sunday this had all cleared out and it was pretty pleasant, but still not as quiet as the lobby bar at a top hotel.

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful... couldn't have been nicer... and that's a little strange for a downtown Boston hotel. The hotel is a bit of a hike to the nearest subway station....may be a 5 to 10 minute walk, but you can reasonably walk to the blue, green, red and orange lines. The nearest is the blue line so getting to/from the airport is a snap. BTW, if its a nice day and you are up for a little adventure in going to the airport, you can walk down to the waterfront and take a water taxi over for $10/person. Reservations suggested.

The hotel is in the financial district and there is not much open on weekends in the immediate vicinity... especially on Sunday. But it's a reasonable walk (again, about 10 minutes) to the waterfront (where there is a Panera"s) or to Faneuil Hall.

If the rooms hadn't been so small I would have given it 5 stars. You need to know that going in, but this is the reason the prices are so reasonable (at least by downtown Boston standards). It's a reasonable tradeoff, and a fabulous deal especially if you are traveling alone.

'Club Quarters Standard: Great Location, Great Hotel'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2012 NEW

The Club Quarters Boston is exactly what you'd expect a Club Quarters to be: small, well-appointed rooms, great staff, and an excellent location. I had a hard time locating the hotel and hotel parking but had a positive experience once I managed to get there and check-in; I would not expect anything else from Club Quarters. The only small issue that I had was one of room location: they were unable to locate a standard room on an upper floor on the first night of my stay and placed me on the first floor, just a few feet up from the street, on an alley, above dumpsters. As a solo traveler, I was uncomfortable with this room location and paid to upgrade my room to a suite on an upper floor. The hotel staff was very understanding of this preference and even offered to move my things to an open standard room on a higher floor for the remainder of my stay. Overall, this hotel provided the same positive experience that I've come to expect from Club Quarters.

'Nice place for a short trip - fire alarm in action'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 7, 2012

The room is small but good for a small trip. Very good location, close to South Station, can be done by walk, in case of very small luggage and no rain. Close to Faneuil Hall. The only comment is that the fire alarm snoozed on our first night, and we were forced to go to the street from the 5th floor, in a rainy night. After the fire squad inspection, it was said that it was a false alarm. Two conclusions: a) the fire alarm connection to the fire squad is working fine b) the fire alarm must be revised for a proper work. In the reception there are 2 self attended machines that speed the process for closing the room charges. There is one living room very nice, for the hotel users, with 2 internet connected machines, as well as a fire place and a desk with free coffe and tea. The hotel rent Ipads.

We were looking for a hotel in downtown Boston for Memorial Day weekend and were having trouble finding anything "decent" for under $200. Found Club Quarters on Expedia for $140/night, which, for its location, was better than anywhere else nearby. Plus, parking on weekends is only $16/night (self parking), which was a steal compared to some other places. So we booked the Club Quarters after receiving a recommendation from a friend and were not disappointed! As other reviews have stated, it's not the easiest place to find. There is a small sign next to the door, and a flag above the door, but otherwise you wouldn't know it was there (and wouldn't necessarily know it was even a hotel). Check-in was painless and they were able to provide us with the mini-fridge that we had requested. We were on the 11th floor right off the elevator. Hallway noise was not a big issue and we couldn't hear anything in any of the other rooms. The room was small, but not as small as I expected. We had our son with us and his pack-and-play and we were able to find a spot to set that up and still have some room to walk around. The room was fairly simple with a desk, bed, TV on the wall, chair (with a work table), and a small bathroom with a shower. I knew to go check the "supply closest" early for extra pillows, which I did and they were there. Going back for something later though, the closet was pretty empty, so if you need something extra, get it early. The TV selection in the room was fine, the bed comfortable, air conditioning worked well. The "Club Room" had a nice supply of free K-Cups for coffee and was a nice inviting room. The bottled water dispenser on each floor was also nice, especially to have some water to take with you while sightseeing. Check-out was painless. A lot of good restaurants in the vicinity, and the location, only three blocks from Quincy Market and the Freedom Trail, and only a block from a T station, could not have been any better. I will definitely look at staying at Club Quarters in the future.

We chose this property for the location which is between two T stops. Couldn't be more convenient! It is also within walking distance of most tourist attractions. We booked 11 months in advance so we got a fantastic price for our room during one of the busiest (and most expensive) times of the year. The room size was adequate, especially since we didn't spend much time there. We were on the 8th floor and it was very quiet, even over the weekend. Loved the coffee/hot chocolate, newspapers and computers in the Club Room. We took advantage of the bottled water which was a nice amenity. Overall we would stay here again!

'Exceeded our high expectations'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed April 9, 2012

We chose Seven Hills for a 35 guest family celebration because the website looked inviting and a family member visited Seven Hills to check it out.
From the moment we arrived and met the warm gracious owner and staff until we left, all of us felt that this was the perfect venue for a gathering of any nature. The rooms were large and impressively furnished. The eclectic dcor was fascinating. The grounds were beautiful and great for walks. The entire staff was helpful and efficient. We and many of our guests are looking forward to return visits.

'Seven Hills Inn in Lenox, MA is a perfect place for a weekend wedding!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed February 26, 2012

We got married at Seven Hills in September 2011. When we were looking for a wedding venue, we wanted a place where we could bring together all our family and friends for a weekend to relax, play, celebrate, have a great time AND have a beautiful wedding. Seven Hills Inn is that place and uniquely so  we did not find anything else like it and haven't since. We were able to take over the entire Inn for the long weekend (in our case, it was Labor Day weekend, so we had three days) and the beauty of the estate, in the midst of the gorgeous Berkshires, allowed us and our guests to feel transported and away from the rest of the world, but also to feel comfortable and relaxed like it was our home, without any stuffiness. For example, we had 20 kids running around all weekend!

The weekend was full of games, music, food, and hanging out at the pool, on the lawn, and throughout the Inn's many rooms and spaces. A favorite moment was sharing breakfast with everyone we love each morning, getting to see family members reunite and people we know from all the parts of our lives get to spend time together. The estate offers a perfect space for everything you would want in a wedding venue: The back lawn is a spectacular spot for a wedding ceremony  we were surrounded by hydrangeas and had the stunning woods behind us, which was also where we took portraits after the ceremony. We also took advantage of the back lawn and patio for our 'rehearsal' dinner, where we opted for a lobster 'bake' picnic table extravaganza, complete with an ice cream Sundae bar and lots of kids running around with glow sticks! The banquet room was perfect for the wedding dinner (as well as breakfast for all the guests) and the music room  with its art deco style floor and bar  made a fun and classy space for dancing the night away. In between, the main living room was a perfect lounge area and the 'heart' of the Inn all weekend where family caught up with one another, people could sit and read, and guests could peruse old family photos. Our friends camped out in the library for a marathon poker game and that is also where we set up a photo booth during our reception. In other words, you can do lots of amazing things at this place!

What makes Seven Hills this special is not just its physical beauty (the Inn is kept up to the highest standards), it is the owners, Robin and Dennis Wong, and the wonderful staff they have put together. From the first moment we met with Robin, we felt well taken care of and this lasts throughout your entire experience, from pre-wedding planning through to very last moment. Robin's background in theater, combined with her enthusiasm for weddings and events, means that you essentially get a wedding planner extraordinaire! She has tons of great ideas, and experience, but is also totally open to customizing and changing things up, to make it the wedding you want it to be. Between Robin, her husband Dennis, who rounds out the dynamic duo, and their amazing staff, we were in very capable hands and they took care of EVERYTHING during the wedding weekend itself. Every single one of our guests was blown away by the venue and the presence and awesomeness of Robin and Dennis!

We could not recommend Seven Hills Inn highly enough! And it is definitely going to be a vacation destination.

'Special wedding venue; even more special hosts'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed February 21, 2012

You seriously couldn't choose a better place for a wedding. We got married at Seven Hills in September of 2010 in the back lawn surrounded by pine and hydrangea. All day, our friends and family had been hanging around the lawn, throwing frisbees, playing wiffleball, and catching up with all those people you only ever see at weddings. Robin managed the ceremony with the precision you'd expect of someone with her theatrical background. Everything went off without a hitch, and many guests wrote US thank you notes for inviting them to one of the best weddings they'd ever attended.

Two things make Seven Hills special for a wedding: the space, and the innkeepers. The space is why we chose Seven Hills. One of those 19th century mansions that dot the Berkshires, Seven Hills has been significantly updated and upgraded by Robin and Denis without sacrificing any of its charm. The guests wander between a music room (with the bar), a parlor dotted with numerous conversation nooks, the ballroom where the tables are set out, and the patio, which is accessible from the other three rooms. What this set-up creates is the perfect alternative to the "everything in one room" weddings you get at most hotels: an organic flow of people from room to room, changing temperatures, lighting, and activities as their tastes dictate. Our guests grabbed a drink, danced, and then when tired retired to one of those Queen Anne sofas to chat with friends or out onto the patio if they'd been particularly energetic. It's totally unlike any wedding venue I've been to before or since--and that's a good thing.

But the innkeepers, Robin and Dennis, went above and beyond, contributing to our night on a personal level. They were friendly and gracious to us throughout the process, of course, but they also stayed up until the last guests had gone to bed, close to 2 a.m. When they discovered that my wife and I had somehow missed out on our own wedding cake, they defrosted the slice they had placed in the freezer and sat with us while we ate it in the formal dining room. They even got us glasses of milk! What is clear is that Robin and Dennis are in the business of weddings for the joy they get from the occasions, not for the money. Eating cake and drinking milk with them after all our guests had gone to bed is one of my wife's and my enduring memories from the night. You couldn't find two better people to put in charge of your special day.

'Beautiful place for a Wedding'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed February 9, 2012

My husband and I were married at this lovely spot in the Berkshires in the summer of 2010. We had been debating between getting married in Boston or out in the Berkshires. The convenience of this Inn left no questions for us. We had a lot of out-of-towners for the wedding, so having on-site accommodations was very agreeable. They also had breakfasts in the morning, which was a nice touch. The Inn itself is very quaint and has a romantic feel to it. There were great locations for Wedding photographs. Our wedding was a more traditional Jewish one, and the Innkeepers were very accomodating for us. We were able to work with them to make this work for us. We ended up with about 130 guests, and the Inn size was just perfect for that. Another nice thing is that for your wedding, you can book the Inn for the entire weekend, just for you and your guests. Robin was very helpful in arranging and organizing the day of events for the wedding. You can tell that she thoroughly enjoys this aspect of her work. And even since our wedding, Robin has kept in touch and we still go to events at the Inn at different times of the year! Of course, I should also add how much more affordable this site is than some others near by in the area. Budget is an important factor in planning a wedding, and they are definitely aware of that. Overall, very good experience here, and I hope we can celebrate other events at this site in the future!

My husband and I celebrated our wedding here in 2010. It was the perfect spot! I loved that the wedding party and guests could stay right at Seven Hills so you didn't have to worry about transportation. Our wedding party stayed in the Manor and our guests stayed in the Terrace Motel.

The grounds are beautiful. We had our ceremony outside and it was perfect. All of the rooms are beautifully furnished and decorated. Robin and Dennis take great care of the Inn.

Robin was extremely helpful and pleasant during the planning process. She catered to all of our requests and made sure everything ran smoothly on the day of the wedding.

I highly recommend having your wedding at Seven Hills!

People-
At the Seven Hills Inn you will be treated like family, friends or allowed your own space. Dennis and Robin Wong, owner proprietors, have a sixth sense in the ability to recognize exactly how their individual clients wish to be treated. I have been witness to their incredible generosity of spirit along with the ability to remain out of the picture, yet insure your every need is met.
Place-
The Seven Hills Inn has unique spirit both inside the structures and outside. The spirit indoors seems to provide a peace within itself that pemeates all who enter. The more your senses become aware the more you notice the richness of the decor which stirs the imagination in many directions. Outside, depending upon the time of year, stirs the inner spirit into a feeling which enhances whatever mood you are feeling. Whether you are inside or outside, as you appreciate your surroundings you will feel the aliveness of all that surrounds you.
Experiences-
Whatever you desire to experience is provided by a unique environement throughout the Lenox and surrounding area. Whether you seek the beauty of the Berkshires, the backroads and mainstreets all is within your reach. Depending upon the time of year entertainment varies in all directions.

A little dated which i think most of the places in the area are. We stayed in the terrace motel and found the room clean and nice for our needs. It was a bit musty but it had windows that could be opened for fresh air. Breakfast was served at 8:30 and although not five star we had no complaints. One thing that would have made the stay a little more enjoyable would be wi-fi in the rooms. This is not a place for early risers such as myself as there is no coffee before 8:30 and no newspapers. A bit frustrating in the absence of wi-fi. Most places I've been to have coffee ready at 7am and newspapers available. My only other problem with the Seven Hills inn is it's location. Pretty but far from any store (for coffee or food). With that said we had a great time and they did a wonderful job with the wedding. I've never been to the Berkshires before and i'm strugling to find the attraction. NY state was much prettier and less expensive.If I did go back I would probably stay at the Red Lion in Stockbridge about 15 min. away. A little more pricey but lively with its very old bar and fireplaces.Plenty of nice shops and pub like eateries. Walk to everything! If you perfer solitude The Seven Hills Inn is very nice

'Another wonderful wedding weekend at Seven Hills Inn'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed September 30, 2011

We recently celebrated our wedding at the Seven Hills Inn. From start to finish, Robin and Dennis Wong and their staff did an exceptional job. The space was beautiful, and they were wonderfully professional. Robin personally contacted each of our vendors to make sure they would be there on time and that they had everything they needed, and we didn't have a thing to worry about during our rehearsal dinner (which we held onsite) or during the wedding itself. Although the weather was beautiful, the ground was wet from all the recent storms, and Dennis spent part of his Saturday locating tarps so that the guests would not be in the mud during the outdoor ceremony. And, when we inadvertently forgot the ringbearer's pillow, Robin was there with a substitute in 5 minutes. Our family stayed in the Manor House, and everyone was delighted with the beauty of their rooms and the included breakfasts. It was such a treat to have the Inn to ourselves for the weekend. I would highly recommend the Seven Hills Inn as either a hotel or an event venue.

'Not bad, Good Location, Good Service'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 13, 2012 NEW via mobile

The location of the hotel is very good. I found the staff to be very friendly and very helpful. The hotel itself and rooms were not what you think of when you go to a Ritz Carlton. When I checked in the friendly staff said, "We have your Marriott Rewards as opposed to your Ritz-Carlton Rewards number on file" and I think that best summed up the stay, a Marriott with a Ritz-Carlton logo. The service was Ritz-Carlton, the hotel and rooms were not. While I was here on business our entire group's room keys simply did not work which was terrible, but Ritz-Carlton staff were on all of the floors to help us get into our rooms, so they did a great job of diffusing the disaster. I give a reasonable rating because of the location and staff, but it would not be my first choice when traveling to Boston again for sure.

'One service problem after another on a short stay'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed May 30, 2012

On a brief stay for a business trip, I found that Ritz-Carlton Boston had one service problem after another. The check-in desk was completely understaffed at 9pm, and no bellman was promptly available to bring luggage up. There was a burned out lightbulb on the desk lamp, and no knob at all on the floor lamp. Setting the (very complicated) alarm clock required a visit from an engineer who needed 5 minutes to figure it out himself. A room service order was delivered incomplete, and shoes to be shined and returned at 7am were returned closer to 7:20 --- and then only after a phone call. Given the high rate charged, this stay was not a good value at all.

The Four Seasons is a much better hotel in Boston, although it has the big disadvantage of not having stall showers (which the Ritz does).

'Last Ritz'

We stayed here to celebrate my birthday in early May and this was our first and last Ritz stay. I chose this hotel with high expectations that were sadly completely missed.

It was truly an overall disappointment with the room, level of service, security, amenities, price, parking.

The room was overlooking the unfinished courtyard with the workers lounging around. Obviously they saw us and other guests. Our view was pretty much the courtyard and surrounded with buildings. Could not see anything beyond the other buildings.

The staff though professional, they were not knowledgeable of the area. Concierges gave conflicting directions to gas stations. Any Courtyard I've stayed at would be better than this Ritz. The lobby was dark, empty, and did not give a welcoming and safe ambiance. The music in the bar was loud with a handful guests (or were there the staff).

The hotel did not provide a safe and secured feeling. Anyone can walk up to the lifts and go to any floor without secured room keys.

The best thing about the hotel stay was "Kenny" the doorman. He's the only one who's knowledgeable and greeted us with smile.

Very, very, disappointing stay. I'd recommend the Westin Copley, Marriott Copley or if you don't mind staying slightly outside Boston, I'd highly recommend Boston Quincy. Very convenient access in / out of freeways, to the city (with the T). Look for my review of this hotel.

We have stayed at Ritz Carlton's on several continents and this was the only one I can comment on so negatively never here again.

The staff at the Ritz, especially on the club level, are very professional and always helpful. Every time we come, my family and I are always greeted by friendly staff members. The club level is great to go to for breakfast and the pecan butterscotch cookies are delicious. The location is great and easy walking distance to Newbury Street. The street the hotel is located on, though, attracts quite a gust of wind that can get really chilly in the winter.

TIP: Avoid the restaurant recommendations, however. Last time they booked us a reservation, we were seated next to the kitchen and the service was not very good.

My wife and I booked 3 nights at the Ritz Boston but decided to leave after 2 due to the unsatisfactory experience.

THE GOOD

Location is great. The hotel is right downtown next to the Boston Commons, subway station and the theatre district. Great for both tourists and business travellers alight.

The gym is Huge and fully equipped. It even has a basketball court.


THE SO-SO

The rooms as okay. Ok size and finish. Nothing bad but nothing distinctive either. Not a Ritz standard though.


THE BAD

The service. Staff are not rude, but you can always sense their condescending attitude. They always do just enough to get by but never there to please.

The parking. If you drive, forget about this hotel. It's $44 on-site, 30 off-site self park a day. This is against advertised rate of 40 and 24 respectively, which they didn't honour. The conceirge were helpful in pointing out cheaper alternatives either (which we found on our own).

Basic amenities are missing. No coffee or tea making facilities in the room. No earphones provided a the gym (they sell them though).

Security is an issue. We were asked for our IDs when we checked in so anyone can pretend to be us. There is also no card limited access through the lifts so again anyone can gain access to the doors. Sure there are police all around the front entrance but they can't tell who are guest who are not.

THE DOWNRIGHT UGLY

Completely uncceptable fire alarm procedures. We were rudely awaken at three am by fire alarm, asked to go down a floor. So we made our way to the floor below only to be told but a staff coming out of the lift that it was a false alarm. There were no staff on our floor directing guests, there were no PA announcements made to stop guests from having to leave the room. Only thing the staff told us was "oops false alarm, sorry". A night's sleep ruin.

***

Stay at the Four Seasons. It's 2 min walk away. Same price, way better.

We stayed here for 4 nights and were very happy with the overall experience. Check-in was a breeze. Room was big (handicap room - so no tub). The only thing negative I can say about this hotel is the beds are small. We were 4 people and got a room with 2 beds and they are doubles not queens. So if you don't have little kids, it will be tight. Still it was very nice. Nice gym, indoor pool overlooking harbor. 5 minute walk to Quincy Market (for food), near freedom trail and the T station is right there. Also there is a bike rental kiosk right outside hotel. I must say it was a little pricey but that is Boston.

This is a great hotel for business or pleasure. The rooms are a decent size and up-to-date and the location can't be beat. It is right across the street from Fanueil Hall and within walking distance of the financial district, North End, and Boston Common. There is a blue line subway station literally right outside the front doors, which I believe is the same line that goes to the airport. Parking is $46/day (valet only) or there is a deck on the other side of the aquarium for about $35/day - but I wouldn't bother with a car at this hotel. Fitness center is one of the best that I have seen. There is also an indoor pool and a sun deck.

4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 8, 2012

Just returned from a GREAT 2 night trip to the Marriott Long Wharf, Boston, MA. Immediately upon arrival, Mike (one of the most accomodating door men) welcomed us and assisted us with our check in. From this first greeting, everyone we came in contact with, was exceptionally helpful and interested in our having a wonderful stay. We had cool weather, with scattered showers one day and were delighted to find complimentary umbrellas waiting for us as we exited the hotel, to sight see. The hotel was impeccably clean. All our special requests were handled immediately, with a cheerful attitude. Extra coffee and a whopping amount of extra half n half creamers were provided. One night my daughter left her IPad in the car, which was already valet parked, and Bob, (another of the door men) gladly, searched the vehicle and brought the ipad to us on the 6th floor. What a wonderful, very well run, hotel. In addition, the hotel is perfectly located across from the aquarium, Quincy Market and Fenuil Hall. Great food and shopping! On our last day, upon check out, we learned that our car could stay complimentary at the hotel till 6pm. What a great perk! The (terrific) valet guys brought us the car and re-parked it 3 times that day, for our convenience. Overall, our introduction to Boston was delightful, and left us wanting to go back!!

'Very Nice upgraded hotel'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 7, 2012

Stayed at this hotel for business/conference. I was told this hotel was completely remodeled in 2011 and it sure looked like it as everything felt new. They gave me a one king bed on the first floor. At first I thought it would be loud with the lobby noise being so close to the lobby but not at all. One thing I found interesting was the lobby bar did close at 11pm, quite early in my opinion.
Workout room was very big for it to be in a hotel however, the swimming pool was quite small if that is a concern.
Location was near the financial district and walking distance to plenty of good restaruants, i.e. Legal Sea Food, and Barking Crab. Cab ride to airport was about $25.

'Perfect location'

This is one of the better Marriott hotels we have stayed: perfect location, modern dcor, and friendly and professional staff. The room we had, however, was a little small, particularly the bathroom, for the price we paid (since last month was Boston's graduation month; the rate was double than normal rate). The towels were not as thick or soft as one would find in other hotels in the same price range. Insulation of the room was very good, except a few boat whistles in the morning (before 7AM), which could be charming if one was awake. We didn't have any meals there (we usually do not eat in a hotel restaurant). The wifi speed was very good. There are a few computers in the lobby with free printing, which is nice (most hotels, including many Marriott's charge fees for non boarding pass printing). Valet parking (no self parking) was efficient with a little premium. Overall, it was a pleasant stay. If the rate is right, we will certainly go back again.

'GREAT RENOVATION, FINALLY!'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 4, 2012

Visited May 30th and was pleased to finally see some renovations! Escaltor still takes you up to reception/check in so bell-hop for large/several bags is a must.
Once at Check-in a new second floor lounge, sitting area has been added. Comfy club chairs with several seating areas, large flat screen TV, library feel with bookcase lined walls and reading material. Also the dark access to the bar/restaurant has been taken down so you can SEE it from check-in. Very light and bright now. Also added a computer work station /business area and separate, lovely, reading, relaxing room with large chaise lounge chairs and a great view of the park across the street. Starbucks still downstairs along with 2 water-view restaurant bars! Water taxi to/from the airport is literally right out the door for $10.00 each way. Rooms still clean and fresh, large bathrooms, good housekeeping. It seems they wanted to apeal to a broader crowd than just families. The indoor pool is key to family fun and is ALWAYS crowded. But on weekdays you can have it all to yourself along with a lovely, large wrap around, outdoor pool deck to sit and enjoy the harpor, sunset or a cocktail. (BYOB, no drink/food service out there). GREAT area for food, across from Legal Seafoods, 2 blocks from Quincy Market/Fanuiel Hall and Boston North End for Italian.
Still a keeper!

It was our first trip to Boston as a family and we needed a place to be close to all areas.
We stayed 3 nights and had two kids around 9 &11. Our friend recommended this hotel as she was a Boston resident for many years.
This is not a super luxury hotel, but we did not need that for a short visit which we were out of the room most of the day. The room size was fair for what we paid. We asked for the extra bed and it was there when we arrived. The room had 2 queen beds as well. The room was clean, the beds comfortable. We had a good view of the Marina.
The location was superb. Easy walk to all nearby areas including the Quincy Market, harbor, the Freedom Trail, Paul Revere's house, USS Constitution (a little further away) ...
Walking distance to the metro and plenty of taxi available. We also took the metro to see the Harvard / Cambridge (very nice), MIT, ......and took a cab to come back.
The hotel is walking distance away from a lot of nice Restaurants with seafood, Italian, ...
The Hotel lobby is modern looking and they have good friendly staff there all the time.
The internet was free at the lobby only.
The ride to the airport was about 15-20 minutes.
We made the reservation with breakfast and it had a good selection for us and the kids.

Overall we enjoyed the visit to Boston and this hotel's location and staff made it much better.

'Very Convenient'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2012 NEW

The Hilton hotel is very convenient for people flying into Boston. They have a free shuttle that will come pick you up from the airport. However, when we got here, we waited for the shuttle for almost half an hour, it only runs every 15 minutes. It's not quite a luxury hotel, but it's very nicely decorated, and they have good service. The view of the Boston Bay area is beautiful from the rooms. In the morning, the shuttle will take you to the metro or the airport or anywhere else you need. It's clean, and quiet and good for relaxing after a long (or short) flight. There were plenty of elevators that were fast. The restaurant at the hotel is very expensive, so I would have to suggest eating somewhere else. Otherwise, the hotel was very nice and near the airport, it was very convenient.

We stayed at the Hilton Boston Logan as we had a long lay over in Boston and we hated the idea of waiting for hours at the airport. We were very pleasantly surprised with this hotel. It's connected to the airport, and just across the Boston Bay's main attractions. The room was very comfortable and the view was fantastic. In addition, you can tell the hotel has been thoroughly renovated as the decor is updated and modern, which is a great plus for the reasonable rate we paid.

It isn't a luxury hotel, but it has just about everything one would want in an airport hotel. A call from the car rental drop-off quickly resulted in a shuttle to the hotel. Check-in was quick and efficient. The room was comfortable, clean, and quiet. There were plenty of elevators and they moved quickly. Most of the staff were friendly and helpful. The exception was the person in Room Service who questioned me when I said there was no menu in the room. I ended up going to the restaurant anyway. The menu was very limited and it was fairly loud, largely because there restaurant and bar are one room.

'The best of the airport hotels'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 2, 2012

people found this review helpful

I have stayed in quite a few hotels that are attached to airports, and most are overly expensive or extremely noisy due to air traffic. I am happy to say that rooms at the Boston Logan Airport Hilton are very quiet, and also very reasonably priced for the location.

I have absolutely no complaints about my experience here. The signs to the hotel are very easy to spot in the terminal, check-in was prompt and courteous, and I received free internet service as a Hilton Honors member. I had one of the best room service meals I have ever had - maybe it was just because I was returning from overseas and was desperate for a steak, but everything I had was delicious and generously portioned. Room was very quiet and well appointed.

Do yourself a favor if you find yourself having to stay in Boston overnight in order to catch a flight, and stay at the Airport Hilton. It is convenient and a good value given the amenities and location.

Walked from Terminal E with our cases, took maybe 10 minutes and was well signed posted.

Checkin was smooth and professional, upgraded to Exec floor due to loyalty card status.

Room is big, kingsize bed, chair etc, bed is very comfie and have not heard much noise whilst in my room.

Ride into Boston is quite easy, the hotel has a shuttle that drops at the terminals and T station, then it's a quick 10min ride into town.

If you eat in the restaurant in the hotel, be warned the pizza's will feed at least 2!!

Do yourself a favor and choose this location when traveling to Boston for business. Oh, and pay the extra few dollars to get a room on the executive level with access to the Executive Lounge.

Although located at the airport, it's a quick 20-min ($20) cab ride to downtown. Or, the courtesy van will drop you off at the public transit, where it will cost you all of $2 to go pretty much anywhere in Boston.

I "discovered" this hotel during the first of my four week-long recent business trips to Boston and rebooked each time after. I originally selected it for price reasons ($150+/night less than similar downtown hotels). I returned because of the experience. Modern facility convenient to airport (5 min by courtesy van or 10 min walk via connected sky bridge. Very nicely appointed, spacious rooms. Excellent, attentive staff. All the amenities one would expect from a hotel at this price point.

If there's any negative comment I would have about the hotel, it would be that it's restaurants serve rather ordinary food at relatively high prices (I found $16 for a run-of the mill hamburger to be disappointing and the filet to be overpriced). However, that was offset by the choice of complimentary breakfast items and hoer d oeuvres available daily at the Executive Lounge.

All-in-all, the hotel is superior accommodations and service at a great value for the business traveler seeking high quality accommodations.

Stayed here one night - the rooms were very large for a big city, hotel all very new and up-to-date. Great views either of downtown Boston or the harbor/Logan airport. Comfortable beds and very quiet. Small refrigerator in the room. The only thing that may bother people is that there is no bathtub- only a standup shower (but it is very large). This hotel is not located right in the middle of all of the touristy locations, but there were always taxis out front or it is about a 10 minute walk into the financial district. Even so, the area all around the hotel seems recently built-up and there are plenty of restaurant options.

'Conveniently close to Logan Airport'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 11, 2012 NEW

If you're vacationing in Boston, this is probably not the best place to stay due to its location. However, if you are traveling to Boston on business, as I was, It's ideal if your meeting/conference is nearby (i.e., World Trade Center).

The Renaissance is comparable to a Category 4/5 Marriott property. Rooms have the Marriott updated furniture, TV, etc., Beds are comfortable and that's one of the reasons I like Marriott.

Despite having a conference complimentary WIFI code, I was unable to connect the second day. Calling the 800 number to resolve the issue was an unexpected surprise. The person was extremely competent and I had no issues after that time.

The area has been built up quite a bit. In fact, the nightlife is quite active as many people were milling about the bars and various eateries. Of course, there is a Legal Seafood within walking distance and an interesting place called Legal Test Kitchen.

I opted for the Lobster Yankee Fish Market which appeared to be a casual place for the locals. This restaurant is only 2 blocks from the hotel and you can arrive casually dressed. It was the perfect place for me to enjoy a lobster roll.

I later found out that the T Silver Line (bus) is immediately west of the hotel. From there, you can catch a ride to the airport for only $2.00. You can also ride in-bound to the city and hook-up with the network of trains. On my last day, I traveled in-bound and went to Quincy Market. It took a couple of transfers, but I managed to get there.

'A satisfying stay, better location than we expected'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2012 NEW

My partner and I stayed here for a commencement ceremony that was taking place at the nearby Bank of America Pavilion. We wanted someplace within walking distance of the Pavilion, and fully expected to be inconvenienced a bit by the hotel's South Boston location in regard to other sightseeing we might want to do. But we were pleasantly surprised to discover that the Silver Line was just outside our door, and offered easy, inexpensive transportation. A few quick connections on the T and you could basically get anywhere, including any attractions and the airport. In the meantime, we also had the chance to explore the South Boston area, and we began to really like it --- it has a different, waterfront-resort type of vibe than the downtown area and yet that difference was very welcome after a day of busy, urban touring. The restaurants were good, the convenience stores were plentiful, and the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) was about a 7-minute-walk away and was an impressive experience if you have a spare hour or two. The hotel itself was clean and comfortable, but i have to admit that the price was too high for what you get with respect to the style of the room (another reviewer was right to question the beach-inspired decor), the lack of a good soaking tub (shower stall only), and no complimentary Interact access. I suppose this is to be expected for a great Boston trip, however, but it does turn my five stars into four when I think about the other high-end hotels I have experienced.

Stayed here for 6 nights before moving onto NY. The hotel was great, very modern, clean, fresh and very friendly staff. Had a great view from the Hotel room and were very close to local transport links! The Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was nice however I would avoid the maple sausages and bacon, pretty disgusting although seemed popular with others! However we had breakfast in the Hotel's Starbucks which worked out much better on a morning. The TV's in the room were a very good size, the bathroom was spacious and clean, the beds were very comfy and I had no problem sleeping in it and it was all very clean. The pool Jacuzzi and sauna are great and the gym is a good size with a good range of equipment. All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Boston, good restaurants nearby, in particular the legal test kitchen next door and the Ben and Jerry's stand over the road is great too, great facilities in the hotel, good transport nearby, and very friendly staff!

'Brilliant Stay at Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 7, 2012

What a gorgeous hotel and a wonderful overnight experience! The hotel is beautifully designed and is in imaculate shape thanks to a dedicated staff who clearly love what they do and take great pride in their hotel.

Our room was modern, spacious, and had every amenity you could want including a great bathroom and the most comfortable bed I may have ever slept in. Not to mention the view! Downtown Boston and the water - gorgeous!

The hotel's pool and hot tub provided the perfect relaxation before dinner, and although I didn't use it, the fitness room was first-rate with free weights, treadmills and plasma TVs on the wall.

Dinner and breakfast the following morning were great experiences as well at the hotel's elegant 606 Congress restaurant. In particular, our server, Jessica, was very friendly, knowledgable and took excellent care of my wife and I. The food was delicious (I recommend the seasoned french fries, no matter what entree you get!), and the atmosphere was perfect for a romantic dinner.

This was really an awesome experience and I strongly recommend this hotel if you are visiting the Boston area, or are an area resident looking for a perfect getaway for a night.

'Great Stay, Great Hotel.Perfect if you are attending an event nearby .'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 2, 2012

I stayed at this hotel because I was attending a graduation at the Bank of America Pavilion, which is less than a block away. It's a great hotel if you are attending an event nearby or if you are traveling on business and all your meetings or conferences are around that area. If you want to explore Boston or you are traveling for leisure I would recommend staying somewhere closer to Downtown or nearer to public transportation.
That being said, the rooms are big,comfortable and clean. And I can't say enough about the beds and the pillows. It was one of the best sleeps I have ever had. Great Views as well.
They have a Starbucks in the lobby if you get and hankering for coffee (I can't say anything about the food in the hotel, since I never ate at the restaurant) and if you want one of the Best Lobster rolls ever, there is a Restaurant called "Yankee Lobster" also less than a block away, and it worth the walk. Amazing!
Because we drove from New York we had a car. Do not leave your car at the Valet. Like all hotels they charge WAY TOO MUCH. Just park your car in one of the various parking lots around the area. Great staff, pleasant and friendly.
It's expensive, but you can see where your money goes. I do wish however that Boston had a better hotel offer with better prices, but hey, that's not the hotels problem.

Really close from South Station and the Silverline stop right in front the hotel. I ordered room service (food) and the only complaint is the 4$ they charge for delivery (which is not great cause the restaurant is inside the hotel). Maybe a 10 min drive to the airport.

'Birch Bar waitress Jennifer'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 14, 2012 NEW

While waiting for a long delay, boarding a Carnival cruise 06/03/12, we were bussed to the Westin, Boston to wait it out. My friends and I chose to spend our waiting time at the Birch Bar, rather than downstairs in the over crowded ballroom.

Our best experience in Boston, over three days, as it regards customer service and restaurant wait staff was by far in the Birch Bar, with Jennifer. The place we spent the very least amount of money from all the restaurants in which we dined, but by far the most pleasant person we encountered.

While this is a beautiful hotel, it's the staff that makes this hotel. Everyone we encountered was so nice, friendly and informative! It's about a $20 cab ride from the airport. A ten min walk to the waterfront and multiple restaurants. We got an excellent rate on hotwire.

'Great place to stay for Concert at Bank of America Pavillion'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 12, 2012 NEW

We had flown to Boston to see Yanni in concert at the Bank of America Pavillion. The Westin Waterfront is a great location for us. We can take the silver line transit to the World Trade Center and walk over the bridge to the hotel. Takes less than 15 min. The rooms are very nice, and clean. I love the beds and pillows!

'Very nice hotel!!'

This hotel is a very nice property to stay. It is very close to the World Trade Center station (5 minute walk) of the transit system so makes getting around Boston very convienent. Highly suggest getting a Charlie pass and get around on transit system - one cab ride will be more than the $15 7-day pass! Downside is that it is away from any restaurants and the main downtown areas, but a quick transit ride and 10 minute walk will get you to downtown. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

'"Business or Pleasure? . Perhaps more business-like.'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 7, 2012

We stayed here as a family before a cruise. The location is great for embarking on a cruise,but for walking right out your hotel door and finding resturants, shopping and sights, No. It was very expensive with taxis getting round downtown .Also, with so many attendees obtaining a taxi was a long wait at times. While we were there there was a major convention of Physicians and the hotel was all business. We kind of felt out of place. They did have a nice Irish bar with live music that lightened up the atmosphere. I think if we had to do it all over again we would select a downtown hotel closer to all the Boston vibe and charm.

'Perfect place for attending a BCEC conference, except for the internet service & restaurant'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 5, 2012

I stayed at the Westin for a week for a conference held at the BCEC. Overall, I was impressed by this Westin except for two near-fatal flaws.

First, the good stuff -- Upon check in, I was greeted pleasantly by the staff. I had to drop off several items for my group to pick up when they checked in, and the staff was very helpful with this.

I booked a small suite since I knew my group would be having several closed-door meetings. What was nice about this was that the parlor was completely separate from the bedroom, so there could be meetings in the parlor while I could do work in my room without being disturbed.

The view from the room wasn't particularly pleasant--parking lots and the side of the convention center--but for the type of room it was and the price paid, it was nice.

Housekeeping did a nice job at keeping the parlor area tidy after each meeting. I would call down once the meeting was finished and they would be up within 10 minutes to service the room. I tipped them for each trip, because they were efficient in turning the room around. It wasn't that my group was sloppy (the room seated six max), it was the coffee cups, bathroom, and room service dishes that needed to be taken care of.

Room service was exceptionally fast--I never had to wait longer than 20 minutes for my meal, although I ordered very simple items. The Irish Pub had decent food and shared the menu with the City Bar. Both had good service and good food.

The Birch Bar was either closed for renovations or cordoned off for a private event. Keep in mind when there is a large convention in town, the City Bar and Birch Bar can be bought out by groups and will not be able to serve the general customers. This is in the Seaport/Waterfront District, so there's really not much within close walking distance. Restaurants like LTK, Morton's, Salvatore's and Legal Seafood are a good 15 minute walk from the hotel.

Now, the bad news.
I had lunch and breakfast at Sauciety, which is the main hotel restaurant. Wow. What a disappointment. They turn the restaurant over at 11:30 AM from breakfast to lunch. There was a group of six people patiently waiting at 11:30 AM to be seated. The hostess blatantly ignored them, ignored me when I tried to flag her down, and ignored two other guests. I know the restaurant is busy changing linens over or whatever, but all the hostess had to do was ACKNOWLEDGE us and we would have been happy. She went out of her way to ignore us. When we tried to flag down the rest of the staff--they refused to make eye contact and scurried away. Insulting, to say the least. When they finally had the restaurant set (which was at 11:45 AM), the hostess and staff deigned to speak to us. Several of us were concerned that the restaurant was fully booked for lunch (they accept reservations, it was the peak convention day, and there were several tables already marked reserved), which was why we were trying to get their attention. I mentioned it to the person who dropped me off at the bar and she refused to respond.

Why I went back here for breakfast is beyond me, except that I was hungry and I had a long flight ahead of me. The buffet is expensive and the waitress was clearly unhappy that I didn't want the buffet. I placed my order, asking for the breakfast potatoes to be cooked without the bell pepper. She said it couldn't be done.

As a veteran of full-service hotel restaurants, I know this isn't true. The potatoes were deep fried and the peppers were added at the end; they weren't cooked together like a hash. She still claimed the restaurant couldn't make it without the peppers. Disappointed, I ordered the small salad and got grief for daring to ask to have the cucumber held. While her service was slow (getting refills on my tea was painful), she was super-quick with the bill. Upon departing, I addressed the hostess about the whole potato thing and she just blew me off.

Finally -- the internet issues. The hotel's servers were down repeatedly throughout my stay, which made working a huge challenge. After speaking with the front desk on the phone, followed by their off-site help desk (which makes no sense having someone offsite to service internet on property, but I digress), they finally said it was an issue with the hotel. Knowing I was being charged $13/day for it, I went down to the desk, asked to have the internet refunded, and asked when they thought the 'net should be back up. No one knew.

What was worse was that the Westin sent automated calls about their Westin Workout, but failed to do so when their internet went down. C'mon, people. All you needed to do was leave a message that the 'net was down, how long you estimated it to be down, and viola! I would have been much happier if I didn't have to keep calling people to get my 'net to work.

Will I stay here again? If I have an event at the BCEC, you can't beat the Westin for convenience. However, I think overall the Renaissance and Seaport hotels are better deals and have more restaurants in the immediate vicinity than the Westin.

This westin was nicely located. The rooms were just average nothing special at all. The value wasn't good in comparsion of price to other hotels in the same price range. I would rather stay at the Boston W for the same price. This seems like a hotel that caters towards more business than pleasure.

'Top notch service!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 3, 2012

I decided to take an overnight road trip to Boston. Since I had never been, I let Hotels.com choose the place and I'm glad I did! The convention center was very busy but the valet noticed me immediately and had me at check in within a minute. I checked in early and no one sighed and rolled their eyes like I've experienced at other hotels. Instead they graciously upgraded me to a harbor view and got me enrolled in the SGP rewards program. Room service was less than a 15 minute wait and I appreciate when I don't have to stop by the front desk to check out. The rooms were clean, the shower was great... I'll be booking with Westin for my upcoming stay in Hawaii because of the great service in Boston.

'This is "ALMOST" and Exellent Hotel'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2012 NEW

We stayed here for two nights at the end off our holiday in New York and MA. We were in City View rooms and the view was indeed fantastic. The rooms were spacious and there was little to no 'airport noise'. Other reviewers complained about the absurd parking charges but that is the norm for city hotels and one reason we choose this one....you can return the rental car and use public transport, water taxi or subway to get into the city - it's very convenient. We didn't eat in the restaurant; I avoid hotel restaurants if at all possible. They are either mediocre or over priced. Besides, if you are on holiday why would you eat at a hotel instead of something local? The staff was friendly and helpful. There are two reasons I can't rate the hotel as excellent. We were gone from our room from around 9AM until 8:30PM and the room was not cleaned. Granted, when we called the front desk they did send someone up but there should be controls in place. The one thing that really annoys me is the 12.95 charge for internet. If you stay in low to mid-range motels, the internet if free. If you stay in a higher-end hotel you are charged. It's kind of like all of the airline fees...you feel a if you are being "gouged". In addition, once I paid the fee, the connection was so slow I might as well have been on dial-up. At least if you are going to charged for it have a decent transfer rate.

Arrived at Logan Airport late in the evening so had booked the Hyatt as a stopover before exploring Boston the next day. Lovely clean Hotel with an unbelievable view of the City by day and Night. If you can get a City view its a plus but if not the public areas and outside all afford a great view. Room was clean, spacious and quiet which is all I ask. Thought the charge for Wifi was a bit steep so steer clear of that unless you are desperate.Shuttle service to and from the Hotel cannot be faulted.

We're from Palm Beach, Florida. My wife and I stayed here over the Memorial Day weekend. The hotel's on the smaller, but yet intimate size for a Hyatt Regency, but the staff more than made up for this. These guys were absolutely great. The person who made our stay the most memorable was Jamie Merlino, the restaurant manager. We ate at the hotel everyday. Ms. Merlino personally addressed each guest during breakfast. I've never seen this - - anywhere. Trust me. We are experienced travelers. Over the past year we've stayed in at least 15 Hyatts (regency & grand) including the flagships in Kauai, Hi, & Dubai, UAE. One evening we returned to our room and found a cheese and strawberry plate awaiting us courtesy of the restaurant. In addition, our last meal was succulent: lobster pasta and a snapper dish that would make your toes curl.

The concierge was also knowledgeable and provided accurate information regarding events and restaurants in the greater Boston area. This was an extremely busy Boston weekend, too: 4 weddings, a celtic home playoff game crowd and 2 proms. The car was also delivered on time with my wife's door opened first! This is a big deal for me. These guys never missed a beat.

Finally, the front desk was also excellent. From the harbor view upgrade to the 4:00 p.m., late check out, to accomodate our evening flight, they were very attentive. The hotel personnel made this stay great. I would return solely because of these employees.

Recently stayed here for a conference. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful in getting me checked in early and directing me to my event. The rooms were clean, modern, and very large. Everything was new and quite clean.

On the down side, I thought my room was pretty expensive given the location away from rest of the city. The nearest T station is a decent hike away. There is a free shuttle to the train as well as the airport terminals that runs about every 15 minutes, though.

'Excellent location, and I never heared any airport noise from my bedroom'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 23, 2012

I stayed here on May 2012, and I loved it. If its your first time in Boston, I highly recommend it, simply because its a great location. First of all, you can take the free shuttle to the hotel, right from Boston Logan Airport (save over $20 in taxi fare, roundtrip), It's only minutes away from the airport, so you can sleep in a little more before waking up to take that early flight home, and you never have to deal with traffic. Second, the views. Wow. if you like the Boston city skyline, you're going to love this place. Sit back and have a drink as you watch the sun set over Boston Harbor. Third, I took the Water Taxi nearby, which was $34 for a round trip from the hotel to downtown (its cheaper than taking a taxi over there). It will leave you in a perfect place for taking Old town trolley tour bus, and Ghost tour venues nearby. You can also eat some good seafood in the variety of local eateries on the bay, and walk off the calories by taking a nice stroll around the historic places of interest.

I stayed at this hotel overnight between two long flights. I was picked up in less than 10 minutes after I called for the shuttle and the check-in was fast and efficient. The room was modern, comfortable and the bed was just the right firmness. It's hard to define exactly but some hotels just feel "right" and when the stay is over, you leave with a very satisfied experience. This was one of those hotels. The Hyatt employees I came into contact with were friendly and professional. I had to go to the airport at 4am and the shuttle arrived within 5 minutes of my waiting at the front door. I have stayed at different hotels in the Logan area and this was by far the best hotel.

'Luxurious, Family-Friendly Stay in a Fantastic Location'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 12, 2012 NEW

We stayed at the Taj Boston in March for 3 nights. It was our first time visiting Boston.

I booked the Taj through an online booking site and was not disappointed- it is a very luxurious and usually way out of my league place to stay. It is in an outstanding location, overlooking the Public Gardens and Boston Common and when you step out of the hotel, you step onto Newbury Street and your wallet practically jumps out of your pants. Newbury Street hosts a lot of high-end stores and high-end shoppers.

Practicality and family-friendliness have become very important to us in travelling with a little kid (he was just 1 at the time) and Taj didn't let us down there, either. When you're travelling with a little one, they bring you a stocked crib and the cutest gift bag filled with baby toiletries (shampoo, baby powder, etc.) and a little stuffed bear. How cute is that?

Taj Boston's staff were really fantastic- always friendly, knowledgeable about the surrounding area and generally warm and kind.

On-site there was a gym and two restaurants/lounges...and....get this....a Chanel store. I didn't go, but I really, really wanted to. Believe me!

Just down the street there are more affordable food options- chain restaurants, a Dunkin' Donuts (which I understand America apparently runs on) and lots of other stuff.

Like I said, the location was so central to everything, we walked every where and used the subway to visit Harvard Square.

Really great stay, totally impressed!

4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 12, 2012 NEW

On entering the hotel we immediately felt we were out of place, it seems the very rich were the favoured customer. The rooms were plush and traditional, the bed was the best I have ever slept in with feather topped mattress and gorgeous plump feather pillows. The restaurants will not allow anyone in with casual clothes such as T shirts, shorts or trainers?? We thought the meals were overpriced anyway so found our way to a variety of choices for breakfast etc in nearby locations.
Boston Public Park and Boston Common are opposite which we found was a wonderful place to relax, see the real Bostonians and take in the sun. All in all a lovely hotel but too stuffy in many ways. Depends what you are looking for and how much you are willing to spend.

'Great hotel, not great value'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 11, 2012 NEW

I stayed two nights during June 2012.

The good: Outstanding location (overlooking the park in the center of Boston). Courteous and knowledgeable staff (as you would expect from a Taj property). Wonderfully comfortable beds and pillows (as Goldilocks would say, "Just right!"). Tastefully furnished. Superb food -- the breakfasts were among the best I've had at any hotel. The fitness room is well-equipped (happy to find free weights).

The not-so-good: Breakfast is NOT complimentary with the room (the only Taj property I've stayed at that did not include breakfast). While the food was excellent, breakfast averages about $45-50 per person! No complimentary internet, either (also a departure from other Taj properties). Considering the extremely high room rates, this Taj seems downright chintzy in not offering complimentary breakfast and internet. The rooms are also not well-insulated from noise -- I could hear everything from the room next to mine. And the telephone in my room was broken.

So overall I would say this is a really comfortable hotel, but not a very good value for the price.

Dear Robert,


Thank you so much for posting your review on TripAdvisor, and for staying at the Taj during your visit to Boston. We take great pride in our comfortable accommodations, fine dining, and central location. We are happy you had an enjoyable stay with us, but disappointed that you were not pleased with the entirety of your stay. We do our best to keep in line with our competitive set in Boston, and therefore do not offer complimentary internet throughout the Hotel.


On your next visit to Boston, I encourage you to try our Express Continental Breakfast in the Bar, which offers hot and cold beverages, fresh fruit, an assortment of breads and pastries, and more for a great value of $19++ per person. Also, we urge you to take advantage of our Breakfast Inclusive Package as you book your next visit to Boston, which is a great value and includes breakfast in the Caf.


Thank you again for staying at Taj Boston, and we do hope you choose to stay with us again on your next visit to Boston.

'Bed configuration'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2012 NEW

My husband and I stayed in this hotel two weeks ago and as we need a bed each I was very careful to book this, however we ended up with a king...no good for us. There were no other rooms to change to and we were offered a 'pull out' bed, which was narrow and hard, as a complimentary free perk! No free breakfast? Definitley not said a very terse voice on the end of the phone. What a shame for such a beautiful, well placed hotel. Wendy and John from N.Z.

'Great venue for wedding- Gluten-free Friendly!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 6, 2012

I recently attended a wedding of a friend at this hotel. I let the waitstaff know I was gluten-free and got totally separate things. I got a salad instead of soup, a separate meal (which I believe was the vegetarian/gluten-free option, but it was very good), and they even brought me crme brle for dessert since I couldn't be served the cake! It was very impressive.
Besides that, it is a lovely hotel and venue for a wedding, overlooking the Boston Gardens.

'Excellent'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 3, 2012

I have spent two nights in this hotel for my business trip to Boston. The location of the hotel is excellent which is at the end of newbury st just across the park. The king deluxe room's size was very good. It has an extra comfortable king size bed, a couch, and a study desk.
The bathroom was small in size; however it was well lay out with molton brown toiletries.
The hotel gym was good but small, it has few treadmills, couple of cross trainers and few other exercise machines.

'First time visitor. Will there be a second?'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 24, 2012

Having grown up in the Boston area, the Ritz Carlton was the place to see and be seen. But, I never set foot inside until I moved 1250 miles away and returned for my daughter's grad school graduation. This was now the Taj and I was skeptical about the change. I was right to be guarded.
Upon arrival (Sat.), it was chaos. The elevators were not working but the management decided not to tell anyone. Weddings were going on; people in for various graduations all over town; and the staff acted indifferent. No one to offer to take our bags up to the room or store until elevators repaired.
After checking in, we went to the room overlooking the Commons. The room was delightful. A trip to the bar before heading out to dinner was exceptional - top service but this is not a place to go into and drink heavily - at least without bringing some gold coins. Pricey. Returned to the bar later for its cupcake dessert bar - trendy and good.
Next morning took six people to the brunch on the roof. Very nice buffet, but not the best i've been to by any stretch. Waiter said he could not take a group picture of us. WTF? Claimed he would be fired. Management should fire anyone who refuses such a request, IMO.
Used the workout area. Adequate machines with top service. How many times have you been offered a towel while on a treadmill?
Finally, had an opportunity to also have breakfast at the Cafe. Good selection and variety. Bring some coin. You are paying for convenience and comfort - any doubt, go have the same meal at the Paramount. Cheaper, but at least you avoid the prison mess hall experience offered at that Beacon Hill eatery.
I wish they offered a choice of newspapers delivered to your door in the AM. I would have preferred the Globe to the WSJ or NYT. Give the people an option.
Seemed understaffed at times in terms of bellmen. As opposed to four people hovering over the person at the concierge asking about the swan boats.
in the end, I did like the hotel better than some of the bigger chains in town or even the smaller older ones. But for the price, I think I will try somewhere new next time.

'Comfortable accomodations and great location.'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 23, 2012

We recently stayed at the Taj in Boston for five days. We were attending our future daughter in law's graduation. This was my first time to Boston. We couldn't have picked a better location. The Boston Gardens were right across the street, and to the right, was Newbury St, where there is plenty of shopping. We also were able to walk to the graduation ceremony, which took place at Emerson College. Our bed was so comfortable, and the hotel nice and quiet at night. We had breakfast in the hotel cafe most mornings and a glass of wine in the bar area before bed. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The cost of the room was a little more than I would like to spend for this type of a trip, but it was worth it.

'NOT a luxury hotel'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed May 20, 2012

We booked a room at the Taj to celebrate our anniversary, thinking that we were booking a luxury hotel. While we had no major problems, nothing about the rooms, the property, or the staff make this a luxury property. It's comparable to many of the local chain hotels, which are better priced. This was immediately apparent by the long line at the check-in desk and the room size and furnishings. The bathroom was downright TINY.

They advertised complimentary car service, so we called ahead to the concierge to arrange dinner reservations and the car. We were told that the car did not go to the North End, which is less than 2 miles away, but only covered the immediate area (so what good is a car service??) and in any event, it was first come, first serve.

We selected a closer restaurant recommended by the concierge, about 6 blocks away, and requested 6:00 pm reservations. When we came downstairs to go to the restaurant and asked if the car was available, we were told that they did not put it into service until 6:00 pm! (I guess guests don't go anywhere during the day.) Why did the concierge not recommend a slightly later reservation time?? When we asked how to call for pick-up when we were finished eating, we were told that the car only TOOK guests TO places, it was not available to bring them back.

This was such a crock. Is there a car service or not? Or does their complimentary jag just make for good advertising?

Other non-luxury touches included: a lack of synthetic pillows. (We were told they were 'out'), very thin walls that subjected us to listening to our neighbor's TV late into the night, a maintenance man who barged in because he said I called him (I did not, but even if I had, I'd have preferred that he wait until I answered the door), over-cooked Eggs Benedict, and an understaffed caf with slow service. (Lots of bus-boys but only one poor waiter trying to keep up.)

The included breakfast was a hassle. We paid a higher room rate that included breakfast, but the staff didn't initially know what included. Finally, they let us order breakfast entrees and said we were 'lucky' because often the breakfast only includes coffee, juice and danish (what they call the continental.) They double taxed us on it, because instead of just giving it to us, they billed it and then credited back all but the tax and gratuity. I was fine with the gratuity, of course, but objected to the tax because we had already paid tax on the higher room rate.

Two good points about staying here. Location, Location, near Newbury Street and the Public Gardens. The second is that, unlike the Eggs Benedict, the strawberries and muesli at breakfast were quite good.

Had this not been billed as a luxury hotel and had we not paid such a pretty penny, I'd have given it a higher rating.

We live in MA and occasionally treat ourselves to a night in the city. Next time we'll do it someplace else.

Dear Guest,

Thank you for choosing the Taj and for leaving your feedback on this forum. We greatly appreciate all reviews, as it is one of the most important ways for us to make the necessary improvements to the Hotel and service. On behalf of Taj Boston, we sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you faced during your stay.

Our complimentary Jaguar service is intended to provide added convenience to our visitors, and apologize that it had been more of an inconvenience for you. We offer this service to all of our guests, and is based upon availability only. In order to provide transportation to as many guests as we can, we have advised our drivers to stay within close proximity of the Hotel. Unfortunately, these areas have not been made entirely clear to some of our staff, as the North End is within this close proximity. I have forwarded your comments to our Hotel Manager, and will ensure the Staff follows the proper protocol pertaining to the car service. Additionally, we will ensure that the staff communicates to guests exactly how this service works, as its functions may differ from other car services. I will also make certain that each issue you encountered is addressed, and we will do everything we can to make the necessary improvements.

We are currently in the process of making various updates to our guestrooms, to include new carpets and televisions. This continuous process is a result of the feedback we receive, as well as our constant effort to do everything we can to create a luxury experience for our guests. We greatly appreciate your assistance in improving our Hotel, and do hope the rest of your trip to Boston was enjoyable. We invite you to stay with us again on your next stay in the city so that we can offer you the true luxury experience that we strive for every day.

Kindest Regards,

'Wonderful Stay'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 14, 2012 NEW

I stayed at the W Boston for fun as I had an expiring free weekend night stay from one of their frequent stay promotions. It was suprisingly easy redeeming this promotion, both in Boston and New York City. No hidden fees, the rooms themselves were 100% free. Check-in went smoothly and I was upgraded to a very spacious king room, complete with all the expected amenities of a W hotel (Bliss products, DVD player, robes, ultra comfortable beds, etc). I booked a massage at the Bliss Spa, which was amazing. As a Beacon Hill resident, I now use the Spa regularly, and it is always an enjoyable experience. Upon returning to my room, there was a handwritten note adressing me by name thanking me for my stay. It was a very nice touch, one I have not seen through my many stays at the W Chicago City Center and W Dallas. I ordered room service, and the food arrived quickly and was very delicious. The room itself was very clean and quiet, despite being in the heart of the Theater District and overlooking the busy Stuart Street. Overall, I found the hotel and the customer service to be exceptional.

Conveniently situated near Boston Common, this hotel may be a perfect hub for exploring Boston, whether you are on business or just for pleasure. Prices are also reasonable. You can also book without breakfast since there is a food court just across the street. Rooms are spacious bright and clean. The only thing that might be slightly irritating is those guys who open the main entrance. Yes, they are kind, but remind me a bit of bouncers.

and the front desk staff. The hotel is nice...very modern and cool looking. But as a guest you get the sense that the hotel management rely too heavily on these facts and do very little else to make this an outstanding hotel. It is a W, so with that comes a few givens: nice showers, spa amenities, cool lounge. But this was hardly the best W of the chain. Not terrible, but nothing "special", which is surprising for a big city like Boston.

'Nice touches, should be copied'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 10, 2012 NEW

This is a good location as others have observed. The lobby, bar and restaurant share the small ground floor area. So, not the grand open spaces of other downtown hotels. The bar service was friendly, but seemed one person short during happy hour. Get a window seat and enjoy watching the passers-by. It is downtown-priced, so four individual sliders and four drinks was $100. Be advised as folks continually note, the valet parking is $44 a night. Self-parking options are limited and would run about $30. In downtown, you're generally gonna walk, cab or T. Pleasant surprises were in the room. Nice shower, marble and large. Bed was comfortable. be advised this is a downtown hotel in a busy area, there is street noise until 2 a.m. and the hotel is on the lower floors of the tower, only to about floor 14 (condos above). Consider earplugs. Very pleasant surprise was a charging station in the room with plugs for mini-USB (cell phones), IPad, and IPhone. What a great idea after I have forgotten these all the time. Three free bottles of water; however, the Boston tap water is fine to drink. The worktable and chair were very nice and the room was spacious with two side chairs, side table, work table, office chair and more. One complaint is the lighting over the sink is only on one side, so shaving involves some head turing. But there is a lighted make-up mirror. Late night (11 p.m.) room service was prompt and the menu and the delivery person explained that the service gratuity was already added. Okay by me. I would recommend it for a comfortable business stay or look location for enjoying time in the city. My spouse says it beats the Westin Copley where we had stayed serveral times, except for the views from the Westin SPG floors on the 40+ floors.

'And the winner for best hotel Shower Head goes to W Boston'

Ya....the shower is wonderful...lots of water coming from this gentle rain fall shower head. This hotel is well located in the city and tries very hard to be 'hip' with the young crowd. We figured this out as we came back from a Red Sox game late at night and had to clear two gentlemen in suits and ear pieces acting as security. When we showed them our hotel key and got it was obvious that night life is key to the W. The rooms are unique and clean. I always wonder why the ore expensive the hotel, and this is an expensive hotel, that you have to pay for what the economy hotel chains give you for free. Ie, wifi, parking, etc. If you are young and hip then the W beckons you.

When we booked the room we had never heard of the W Hotel before so didn't really know what to expect. The drive to Boston was stressful with traffic backups for much of the way. When we arrived at the hotel we were stressed and tired. I went to check in and my husband and daughter sat down near the elevator to wait. Within minutes an employee noticed them and offered to get them something. When I came back a short time later my husband was sipping an ice cold beer and smiling. The hotel advertises "whatever whenever" service and they truly do just that. Our whole stay was as accommodating as our initial greeting. We always look for a W hotel now when we travel.

'Good, but seen far better W's'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 7, 2012

Overall, this is a good hotel, but I can't help compare service and decor to others - like W Kowloon or W Istanbul - and feel there is room to improve.

Positives: Good location, close enough to downtown and South Station (I like to walk). Chinatown is around the corner which means restaurants galore, including a nice vegan one on the corner of Washington and Beach (I think). There is also some F&B choice right across the street. Good, smooth check in, was offered my choice of Gold awards, polite. Room is very comfortable, bathroom's spacious, there is no tub which is to me a plus as it leads to cleaner lines and more space in the shower area.

Negatives: These are not so much negatives as very subjective opinions and room to improve. The first thing that hits you when you enter the room in the evening is the harsh fluorescent lights - perhaps this is to do with energy conversation, but lighting, carpeting and even the bathroom flooring just did not give the "W image" that I have in mind. Almost reminded me of Westins instead. Housekeeping forgot to replace a consumed complimentary bottle of water on day 2 of my stay, forcing me to open a $7 bottle of Fiji in the middle of the night to parch my throat - forgetful or devious, I don't know. The next day they did give a new bottle. The room itself, was basic - I am not sure I was upgraded for being a lifetime gold: the check-in person did not mention anything about an upgrade (I like to know, it is ok if I don't get one, but I wish they would explicitly say whether they can or not deliver on a promise to upgrade whenever possible that they make to all Gold and Platinum members - you must be upfront on these things, not hide and sweep it under the carpet). Instead he announced that I'd have a room with a king - sorry, but that is what I already signed up for so it hardly deserves trumpeting. And had they indeed upgraded me, and if this is my upgraded room then the standard rooms must be rather standard indeed.

I booked this way ahead using Starwood points..was always told if your using points not to book directly with hotel but call SPG. I told the rep I had stayed at a W before and didn't have a good experience and he assured me he would note that and also told me to ask for an upgrade. I did and was told nothing available..it was 2pm and I was told it was a little "early" for check-in...? and they could do nothing for upgrade..(there were 4 people going to be in the room.) I was told by the manager I should have called the hotel directly but trying to do that in the past was told to call Starwood if points were being used...this is the only hotel (the W) that I've had problems with. The manager did send up some drink vouchers ( we got them as we were returning to the room for the night so needless to say, were not used.) Room was fine ( they did move us up to a higher floor, after I felt like I begged.) Don't think I would stay again...just didn't feel any customer service for being a Starwood member..also the manager twice said..."well., other people have paid for their stay"....I don't know how she thought I acquired these points...obviously by buying and earning them...oh...and when she checked reservation...there were no notes...so shame on the Starwood rep as well if he just told me that and didn't do it...

Massive bedrooms, really great bathrooms and bath products. The house breakfast are plentiful and offer a really good wide range, and the local restaurants do room service !! Perfect.

The pub on the square does the best pulled pork and ribs, and loris diner an amazingly massive breakfast.

Having in mind the Golden Gate Bridge 75th anniversary, we decided to stay a couple of days in the city; we choose it mainly because its location, our previous experience with other Fairmont's hotels and tripadvisor reviews.
First of all, this is not your average hotel, what you get is an apartment fully equipped in the city with all the amenities of a luxury hotel.
Secondly the staff goes above and beyond, every one of them; their attention has not rival in San Francisco.
All the above united to the little details this hotel offers you such as house car, ambiance music every time you enter your room, fitness facility open 24 hrs, coffee and tea all day at the lounge, cheese and wine afternoon hour, daily breakfast, immediate attention to all your requests; make you feel at home.
Thank you Fairmont Heritage Place Ghirardelli Staff for make our San Francisco stay a splendid holiday.

We booked a 2 bed suite. Upon arrival valet took care of our car. We had a warm welcome. The staff are great. It's not a typical grand hotel entrance - more practical but the best is yet to come.
Checked into our suite - music was playing on the more than ample sound system. Huge living room, dining room and kitchen. 2 good sized bedrooms. Perfect for a long stay though we were only there for 3 nights.
Luxurious, clean and appointed to the highest of standards. You even get an iPad in the room!
Kitchen had everything you need. There is a washing machine and dryer - with all powders supplied.
The location in Ghiradelli Square was fantastic. Shops and restaurants all around yet very quiet. The most comfortable beds and the best sleep after a day out in San Fran.
They have BMW bicycles you can borrow free of charge. We had a great time cycling around safely round Fisherman's Wharf with the kids. They even supply helmets, rucksack and a bike lock and bottles of water - very thoughtful.
Breakfast is continental but it is easily enough to kick start the morning.
The kids were tired one afternoon so stayed in, ordered free DVD movies via the huge selection and when room service brought the DVD, they bring along a complimentary bag of microwave popcorn. Nice touch.
We would love to go back and stay longer. There is so much to do - Crooked Street is not far away. You can get the tram from nearby which is an experience. Really enjoyed our stay and though it was pricey it was completely worth it.
Very impressed with the way Fairmont dealt with our enquiry from beginning to end.
Highly recommended.

We booked this location because we used to live in the neighborhood, and were we ever impressed with the changes! First off, we were met at the airport by the house driver, who was nice as could be while we wrestled with the paperwork of lost luggage! We arrived at a very discreet entrance and were whisked into a world of pampering. We were greeted by Jeremy, who informed us that he had upgraded us to a 2-bedroom suite (did our driver inform him of our frustrating little luggage experience?). Whatever, we were happy to be treated so nicely!
Our view wasn't much (the high-rise next door), but we took full advantage of the lovely terraces (shielded from the wind and heated, one with a fantastic view, the other just off the member lounge). The included breakfast (fresh-squeezed orange juice, Illy Coffees, fresh fruit, assorted breads and pastries, cereals and oatmeal, and a hot entree) certainly did the trick for us, and we kept meaning to join the complimentary wine reception, but ended up with so much wine from our excursion to the wine shop in Ghirardelli Square, that we just took it up to the terrace and enjoyed the view and the fire pit.
Our apartment was very nice, with a nicely equipped kitchen with a very clever dining arrangement, living room with fireplace, and two bedrooms and bathrooms. There was also a washer and dryer in the unit, as well as a laptop safe in the master bedroom closet. Bicycles were available for guests to use, as was the wonderful house car. We used the house car several times to ferry us to one restaurant or another.
The staff was impeccable. The housekeeping staff was everywhere, from polishing the rails outside to the twice-daily service. I'd single someone out, but it wouldn't be fair to do so because everyone was spot on.
This is a great place for couples, families, and groups of friends. The location is surprisingly quiet, and there is so much to do right outside your door.
My only suggestion would be for management to make the coffee/tea service available all the time. We noticed quite a few international guests and they can be on totally different timetables. The Fairmont Tea, by the way, was delicious!

Not only was The Fairmont Heritage full of charm and comfort it was supported by boutiques, cafes, exquisite restaurants to mention just a few. Thank you Trip Advisor for helping me make the decision to choose this Hotel for my group.

For years, I stayed at the old Ritz Carlton when I came to Boston. But after it was taken over by the Taj and its service fell off a cliff, we decided to try somewhere new. We decided to spend our 15 year anniversary in Boston at the Four Seasons. We reserved a park view room. I was surprised when we were shown to our room; it is basically a Holiday Inn layout with nicer furniture and carpeting and view. The allocation of the space is the same, the layout is the same, etc.

The service was excellent, the food was very good, but the room itself, especially for a room that is at the top of the room hierarchy, was completely unimpressive.

We had a deluxe room and it was very spacious and absolutely immaculate. The attention to detail is what makes this hotel, on top of all the usual things you get in a 5 star hotel. Things like a night light in the bathroom, book mark placed inside the book that you've left on the side, cuddly toy for kids to choose at reception to accompany them for their stay and loads more little things are what makes this hotel stand out from other 5 star hotels.

The location is ideal for seeing Boston. Most things are walking distance or the "T" is just a short walk away.

I cannot praise this hotel enough and would definitely return.

This was a birthday surprise for my girlfriend, since we couldn't get away, I decided on a staycation. We arrived at The Four Seasons and to say the least she was "shocked" when the doorman opened the door and asked if she was checking in. Her reply was "I don't know", but we were and for the next two days, all was perfect! Check in was a breeze and we were upgraded because of my AMEX card, which includes a number of amemities. Our Executive Suite was wonderful, two rooms with a view (4th floor) of the Public Gardens, amazing, amazing view. I had called the hotel the day before to have a dozen roses in the room and they were beautiful (Winston's). Two minutes after arriving in the room the door bell rang (yes, a door bell) and a server brought in a birthday plate, a small dessert with a birthday greeting. Everywhere we went in the hotel you are greeted by name and the answer to every request is yes. Drinks in the Bristol lounge were great and the bartender was better (sorry forgot his name) great conversation about the changes in the bar business.

That evening we decided on room service and we had to try the Bristol Burger, we have had them a long time ago at the bar, but room serivce can be tricky. Not here they arrived on time and as ordered. Mine med-rare and hers medium. they were fantastic, the fries awesome. as we ate we marveled at how they arrived at perfect temp from room service when some restaurants can't do it from kitchen to dining room.

Room service breakfast was wonderful, the food , the view, the champagne, Yes! Later that day, my girlfriends actual birthday another birthday treat arrived a dessert with a birthday wish. We decided to have her birthday dinner at the Bristol Lounge and it was superb. Though it didn't start that way. The restaurant was busy and we were seated at a banquette with a "gentleman" with a voice that suggested he was sitting next to you, as I looked around our wonderful server suggested a different table, Thank you. From there dinner was wonderful, the short ribs fantastic and my young ladies filet excellent. Another birthday dessert arrived at the table with her name on it. A great meal, a great server, a great restaurant.

Wednesday was check out and back to the real world, for me it was early packing everything and the bellman packing the roses (great job, thanks). My Love was able to stay for a few extra hours with late checkout and the hotel car to get her to work. She used the gym every day and loved the staff and space.

Four Season's prides itself in customer service and they rarely fail! A great stay in a great property with a staff that cares about it's guests. For a special occasion make it The Four Season's

If you want to be near prime shopping, Newbury street, touristy sites and a short walk to the theater district, the Copley Marriott is it!

Check-in:
Was a fast, easy process.
Note: I can see though during busy times how they could be potentially overwhelmed, so if you see the crowd just head over to the right and check your luggage with the concierge and take a walk!

Room:
Didn't have to wait a while for the elevator, which is nice in a larger hotel. The room was very clean, on the smaller side, by typical for a Boston hotel. Very nice bed and pillows. Flat screen TV, everything you'd expected from a Marriott.

Fitness Room:
Very nice fitness area. Solid amount of treadmills, ellipticals and other machines. Small selection of dumbbells and a nautilus circuit. Big pool for laps, along with a hot tub.

Location:
A couple blocks from Newbury, a couple blocks from the church and library, a maybe 1 to 1.5 miles from Boston Common. Grocery store across the street and of course a fantastically high-end "mall" on the 2nd floor that spans over to the prudential building. The hotel sits between the Prudential building and the John Hancock building.

Price: Varies WILDLY. My corporate was fantastic, not a single complaint.

When returning to Boston for MIT reunions we often stay on campus in the Marriott there - but this time we opted to stay in the Boston Marriott Copley Place. What a great selection as it allowed for easy walking to upscale shops in adjoining Copley Center, The Prudential Center, as well as Newbury Street - making it a a teriffic close choice when one tires of shopping/walking. The hotel itself had wonderful valet and cab service, the rooms were quiet and clean, and there are numerous public areas allowing for friends to meet.

This hotel is really central with easy access to the Prudential Center, Newbury Street and the shops in the Copley Center. The nearest T station is in the Prudential Center and is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. It is a large and busy hotel so you may wait some time for a lift or service at the front desk. The "lounge" area is essentially part of the thoroughfare for the shopping center so van be exceptionally busy. The queues at Starbucks are long at peak times. This is a hotel to use for either business purposes or shopping - you would not stay here for a quiet break!

Stayed at this property for five nights to attend a conference and visit my daughter. While I have been to Boston several times, this was my first stay at the Marriott. Centrally located. Front desk staff were exemplary, making check-in feel like a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons - obviously well trained and managed. Small lobby that is often quite crowded and loud. Rooms have been recently renovated, so both the furniture and soft goods are fresh. Great corner room on high floor with view of Back Bay and the Charles, but bathroom is tiny and ho-hum. The only restaurant is a combo sports bar. Cold breakfast buffet was way overpriced, though the staff were very friendly and polite. Instead go to the Au Bon Pain in either of the two adjacent retail centers - better selection and half the price. Also be sure to shop at Shaw's grocery store immediately across the street for bottled water and snacks. Lastly, for a great salad bar, check out the Blue Glass Cafe on the ground floor of the John Hancock, a couple blocks away. Instead of the Green Line at Copley, consider using the Orange Line at Back Bay Station. Just as close and faster.

'Chaos at power failure'

I was in Boston at the Marriott Copley for the weekend of May the 3th 2012. We returned for just 1 night on May 7th in order to fly out of Boston the next day. At 11 am. when ready to leave the room the power went off for more than 90 minutes. I was amazed that the hotel didn't have or where not working the emergency power plants to be able to handle at least the elevators. I had to stay in my room for more than 2 hours until the hotel staff allowed me to go down using the elevators.

This can't happen in a more than 40 floor hotel building in a 5 star hotel. It was extremely frightening. NO EVACUATION PLANS  NO STAFF TRAINED TO HANDLE THIS KIND OF EMERGENCIES.

My husband and I stayed here for one night while traveling around Massachusetts. It is connected to shopping and restaurants. We were able to walk to Newberry Street for shopping and dining from the hotel. Also, it is not a far walk to get to public transportation. We checked out of the hotel at 11 am but wanted to walk the freedom trail. The front desk said they would store our luggage with no problem. The staff were very friendly and the view from our room was outstanding. We had a room on the 21st floor and it looked out to the water and downtown buildings. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. I would definitely stay here on a return trip to Boston. Very nice hotel.

I stayed at the hotel for a recent convention. I was in one of the newly remodeled rooms on the 24th floor. The bed and linens were great! The room had a modern flat-screen TV and a nice view toward the river. The location was also very convenient for the rainy weather as skybridges connect to nearby shops and malls. The only complaints were that the cleaning crew needs to pay a little more attention to detail as I found stray hairs on the bathtub -yuk! The bathroom also seemed to lack any exhaust fan so it steamed up quite a bit.

'Convenience in Boston'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 30, 2012

We spent the day as tourists in Boston. Somewhere between check in and catching the trolley for a tour of Boston which arrives directly outside the hotel door, the Mr. lost his credit card. The hotel staff was extremely helpful and immediately notified security. After a fruitless search of the places we had been, we stopped at the concierge desk and they called security. The card was there and the concierge person immediately went to collect the card. Above and beyond I thought.

The room was very comfortable and clean. Bathroom was small, but we are talking about a place where space is at a premium. We had breakfast at Champions on site and it was very good. I also loved that there was free internet in the lobby and on the second floor.

Hotel location is connected by walkway to Prudential Center. Extremely convenient if you want upscale shopping. Would definitely stay at this hotel again when in the area.

'Super nice stay and centrally located'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 15, 2012 NEW

This was my third visit to Boston and since the Sheraton was the headquarter hotel for the conference I was attending I decided to give it a try. I really enjoyed my stay here and was a perfect stay. I was put up in the north tower with a distant but nice view of the Charles river. The stay was very comfortable and I had no issues with anything. I would recommend it to anyone.

Pros:
Wonderful location in Back Bay. You don't have to even exit since the hotel is directly connected to the Hynes convention center, the prudential mall and several shops and eateries. Well contained. Perfect for convention center visitors and great for rainy days.

Nice spacious and comfortable rooms. Good and prompt room service and amenities.

Room service was also excellent and not very pricey.

Free bottled water and Starbucks blonde brew.

Minor Cons:
Same old story of paid Wi-fi even for SPG members unless you are platinum level (so much for membership), but the saving grace was good connectivity and speed.

The two towers face each other so you get nice views of not only the Charles river but also of the rooms in the south tower if the shades are open. Not a great thing for privacy.

'Excellent location but expensive and dated'

We stayed at the Sheraton as we were attending a school reunion in Boston. The location is very convenient as the hotel directly connects to Boston's prudential building and shops and fancy shopping center Copley place (including a legal seafoods restaurant, cheesecake factory, pf changs, a religious chapel and many shops). A lot of other amenities within the hotel include a starbucks, a post office/business center etc.

Reception checkin was average and did not take too long. The rooms are ok but the bathroom was small. although we got a Starwood preferred guest rate the hotel rooms were very expensive. I think we expected a lot more than we got. The club level breakfast was also very average, nothing vavavoom for the room price we paid.

'Perfect location in a wonderful city'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 14, 2012 NEW

We stayed at the Sheraton for 6 nights and enjoyed it very much. Location is perfect: close to lovely Copley Square, the shops and cosy breakfast places on Newbury Street, Prudential Center (Skywalk & shopping), the T station around the corner (easy access into the city to almost everywhere you'd want to go). The restaurant scene is amazing in Boston! We thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful city as well as our trips to Provincetown (Cape Cod) and Cambridge (Harvard Univ). Service at the Sheraton was rather impersonal but certainly not lacking. Our room was in the south tower on the 14th floor, close to the elevator and ice machine but we did not experience any discomfort or noise. View on the city (huge window), very big room (2 queen beds), bathroom OK, aircon working excellent, complimentary bottle of mineral water daily, coffee and tea facilities. PS: We found the staff at the Starbucks in the hotel rather unfriendly. But definitely: Visit Boston! You'll love it!

'One of the best in the area'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 14, 2012 NEW

I stayed here for 10 days on a business trip.

Location: It's a 5-7 min walk from 2 metro lines (Orange line and Green line). 15 min walk from the waterfront. 15-20 min walk from frog pond ice-skating rink. It's on the edge of a huge shopping complex. A grocery store 5 min away. Bustling upmarket shopping street (Newburry St) in vicinity. Lots of eating options around. You can't ask for more.

Inside: Rooms aren't exactly huge sized but look fresh. Beds are comfortable, and interiors soothing & up-market. Breakfast was continental, basic but very nice.
Housekeeping is efficient, reception staff very helpful.
They have a nice Gym and a small but clean indoor pool. There are some ballrooms and convention halls as well but I had no opportunity to use any of that.

I'd not hesitate to stay with them again!

'Overpriced, but clean; central location'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 13, 2012 NEW via mobile

I have no complaints about the hotel itself: the rooms are clean and have all of the basic amenities, there is a nice pool and fitness center, and the location is near many shops, restaurants and walking distance to the Public Garden, Boston Common and The Charles waterfront. However, the hotel is overpriced given the amenities, the restaurant is overpriced with slow service and sub-par food. More importantly, the staff is unfriendly, bordering on rude. Upon check-in they had no record of the specifics of my room request (king room, etc) and had made no note on my colleague's account when he had called ahead with a specific request. They made no apologies and requested to see my confirmation email (sent by them) before she would begrudgingly honor the room reservation I hade made months prior.

I took my wife for a special get away to this hotel and can tell you that the staff, service, and condition of this hotel are excellent. The front desk was very attentive and did a great job in welcoming us. Our room was fantastic and exceptionally clean. The location of this property is in walking distance to most area destinations. We were lucky enough to catch a prime rib special at the hotel bar and it was the best we've ever had.

Thank you to the management and staff for making our trip special and memorable.

'Good location mediocre for the price'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 12, 2012 NEW via mobile

I was in Boston for a meeting and stayed at the Sheraton. The check in process was fine but the description of the rooms is missleading. I was assigned a room with double beds but was offered an alternative of a room with a queen bed and a access bathroom. I chose the queen, it was a mistake, the room was tiny and smelled of mildew. I changed rooms to the double which was larger but still to small to leave the ironing board out. Bathrooms are so small the door must be shut to use the shower.
No microwave or refrigerator and thirteen dollars a day for Internet.
For meetings this OK but for any other stays I would look elsewhere.

My business host in Pacific Hts recommended it. It was an exceptional, cozy, and elegant hotel. Very traditional, high-end B&B w/some nice European touches. The 7/24 coffee and tea in the sitting room was more like 7/23, IME. It took three requests at the desk to get it restocked, which took an hour. Business center is marginal and small - amazingly they had no PowerPoint viewer program installed. Astonished that a hotel in the middle these VCs and hedge fund mgrs, had a biz center w/no ability to look at a PP preso. Could download it in minutes, but had no "administrator" privileges, nor did anyone in the hotel. One of the staff did persist, and they were getting one "soon" when I left 3 days later.

Be careful what room you get; booked 6 wks in advance on hotels.com. The room (109), was next to the elevator, next to the 7/24 front desk, on first floor landing surrounded by all the up and down stairs. With towels under the door, ear plugs and exhausted from a long flight, I made it work. Unable to switch rooms first night, but they did switch the next two nights to a lovely room, 301. 109 shouldn't really be a guest room, and I don't believe it typically is as they delayed 2 hours getting it "ready" b/f they gave it to me.

Breakfast is excellent "extended self-serve continental".

BTW, the wireless routers are under the bed in each room, so if you lose svcs, turn it off and on again. The WiFi in the sitting room is only OK as router is in another room; in rooms is excellent.

I'll go back, but it was not "excellent" this trip.

I hoped to be in the same room location for my second stay but it didn't look like the stars were going to align. I spoke to the wonderful, accommodating, professional front desk staff prior to my arrival and voila, when we checked in we were very pleased to be given the key to a terrific room. This hotel is so intimate, you feel like the small staff are all looking out for you as you come and go past the lovely front desk. The breakfast is outstanding and relaxed because again, the staff ensure you have everything you could possibly want. The Drisco is perfect if you are looking to get out of the congestion of Union Square and away from large, corporate hotels, but it comes with service and decor that in fact exceed that of many upscale hotels.

Dear Guest,

Thank you for your kind comments! I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay with us!

I particularly liked your comment about the Drisco not being the hippest hotel around, because I'll admit it -- we're not hip. 'Swish' and 'cool' are also not words that leap to mind to describe the vibe here at the Drisco. "Trendy' is a tougher word, though, because although we eschew the transient and fleeting fads in our popular culture (if it's a professional dog-walker on staff or in-room web cams you're looking for, we can recommend some alternative hotels to you), we're definitely ahead of the curve when it comes to providing incredibly thoughtful touches to make our guests comfortable. Among our recent additions:

* Ambient noise-cancelling devices in every guestroom. We realize that being away form home in an unfamiliar environment leads to less-than-restful sleep for some, so we provide these devices to help guests fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly.

* State-of-the-art WiFi -- blazing fast and free. We jumped on the WiFi bandwagon years ago, and adopted one of the earliest generations of this technology. When our guests started using iPhones and iPads more often, this older WiFi technology didn't measure up, so we are right now in the process of installing a cutting edge WiFi system.

* A complimentary "extended" continental breakfast that is second-to-none. In fact, virtually every amenity we offer here at the Drisco is free (including, now, local phone calls) but many of our guests appreciate the wonderful breakfast we offer over everything else. Start your day in the French way with an espresso, a fresh-baked croissant, Plugra butter and organic jam. Or try our hand-made granola with wildflower honey sprinkled atop local sheep's milk yogurt. And if you're not looking for a carb load, sample our meats and cheeses and (on a weekend morning), smoked salmon. There's so much more on offer as well.

I could go on, but by now you have probably read many of the other comments here on TripAdvisor from our guests describing our other amenities in detail. You can also check out the amenities page on our web site, or you can always call and ask for me personally if you have any questions -- I am at your service!

Being a magazine editor at one of the largest magazines in the country, I get to stay at some pretty amazing hotels whenever I go traveling. My husband lovingly teases me that unless it's a five star hotel, I won't even enter the property. He's kind of right...but I do love the luxury of a amazing hotel room. As a former San Francisco native, traveling to San Francisco is always something extra special and there is nowhere more special than staying at the Hotel Drisco (and I've tried all of the top 5 star hotels in this city). Location-wise, you can't get any better than this. You're living in the most gorgeous residential area in the city, with walking distance to Fillmore Street and Union Street. And the hotel? Absolutely lovely. The building is a historic Victorian with all its charm and beauty. Every part of the property, from the inside out, has been lovingly restored. The entire building was recently renovated and the new interiors are beautiful, soothing and pristine. And the staff! They're simply incredible. They make you feel as if you're a long-lost relative. The amazing breakfast buffet and the lovely wine and cheese hour every night (both included in your hotel room price) enhances the feeling of you staying with family. I love this hotel so much and it's the #1 hotel I recommend to anyone who is visiting my favorite city in the world: San Francisco. Stay here! You will never stay anywhere else.

Dear Guest,

Thanks very much for your wonderfully kind comments. I am so glad that you love the Drisco!

I have always loved the Drisco, well before I ever became the General Manager here. This property reflects my personality and meets my needs better than any other hotel in San Francisco. However, it is so important to us that our guests enjoy their stay here, that I feel compelled to point out that the Drisco is not the perfect hotel for everyone.

For example, if you are looking to be in the center of the action, if you thrive on the vibrant pulse of jam-packed crowds, if you want to be within 60 seconds' walk to shopping and dining, then there are simply other hotels better suited to you in San Francisco. If, however, you feel at home tucked away in a high-end residential neighborhood at the top of a hill, but still close to world-class shopping and dining, then you can't beat the Drisco.

If you require an environment completely free of ambient noise, there are other hotels in San Francisco that have been built much more recently, with state-of-the-art soundproofing. The Drisco was built in 1903 with traditional wood-framed construction. The floors can creak a little, and the windows open wide to let in both the fresh air as well as the sounds of the neighborhood.

If you always look for the hippest, hottest and newest hotel, there are more modern hotels than the Drisco, to be sure. However, if you appreciate classic elegance and warm, friendly service, you simply cannot do better in San Francisco than a stay at the Hotel Drisco.

Not only is the property immaculate, in a quiet safe neighborhood, and full of San Fran charm, with an outstanding complimentary breakfast and wine reception (both way beyond expectations) but the real stars are the staff who understand hospitality at a level I have never experienced. To the person, they seem genuinely happy to meet you and go out of their way to help you have an outstanding visit. We were in San Fran on very unpleasant business, but because we stayed at Hotel Drisco, we almost felt that we were on a mini vacation. Hotel Drisco will be my first choice whenever I travel to San Fran in the future. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation. You'll not regret it.

The staff remembered our names (nice customer service touch), and they were VERY courteous and helpful. The continental breakfast was great; nice selection...so many temptations...just throw the diet out the window and dig in! The tea/coffee room was a nice touch. We took a cup of tea back to our room every evening. The water adorned with sliced, fresh fruit was tasty too. We didn't have a chance to try the wine and cheese tasting in the evening, but it sure smelled wonderful! Well done all the way around. Nice amentities (loved the chocolate dipped cookie each evening), comfortable/clean rooms, friendly staff, quiet neighborhood...what a GREAT find!

Dear Guest,

Thank you for your very kind comments about your stay with us. I'm very pleased that you felt the staff were like family! I especially appreciated your "room tip" about the more expensive rooms with views and the less expensive rooms without views, since this topic generates a lot of comments form our guests, and I would like to take this opportunity to describe our rooms in some detail:

We have 48 guestrooms here at the Drisco, of which 19 are suites. Every suite faces the exterior of the building, with the City View Suites and Two Bedroom Two Bath Suites providing wonderful city views and the One Bedroom Suites looking out on our lovely neighborhood. The other type of guestroom that faces the exterior and offers city views in our City View Deluxe King guestroom. If a room that faces the exterior of the building is important to you, you will want to book one of the room types mentioned above. Because of their larger size and the more expansive views offered, these are also our more expensive room types.

If you would like to experience all of the wonderful complimentary services and amenities we offer here at the Drisco, but at a slightly lower price, then choosing one of our Deluxe King or Deluxe Queen rooms is the way to go. The majority of these rooms face our interior courtyard. We keep our courtyard very neat and tidy, but there are no city or neighborhood views from the majority of these guestrooms.

Lastly, if you are a real bargain hunter, I will let you in on a secret here on TripAdvisor that you will not find on our web site -- what we call our Detached Bath Guestrooms. These are our least expensive rooms (while still offering all our wonderful complimentary services and amenities). The important things to understand about these rooms are: 1.) The rooms have completely private bathrooms but your private bathroom is located across a public hallway, 2.) the rooms are very small and do not have desks and 3.) There are no views from these rooms.
Our Detached Bath Guestrooms are not available online -- please call the hotel directly and specifically ask if one of these rooms is available for your dates of stay.

Thanks again!

From the minute we arrived at the hotel the customer service was outstanding. The room was exceptionally clean and was outfitted with everything you could possibly need. A call to the front desk for extra pillows had them at our door in 5 minutes. The continental breakfast was delicious and beautifully presented (the lattes were wonderful!). I even took advantage of the gym which, although small, had everything I needed.
We walked to Union Street when we first arrived and had lunch at Rosa's Cafe...another great find! The hotel is in a gorgeous, safe neighborhood within walking distance of the shops and restaurants on Union St. if you love to walk.
I fell in love with San Francisco on an extended visit in 2010 and now I have fallen in love with the Hotel Drisco. I can't wait to go back!

Dear Guest,

Thanks for your kind words! So glad to hear you have fallen in love with the Drisco!

In your review you mentioned walking to Rose's Cafe (one of my favorites), and I wanted to take the opportunity here to describe a few of the other restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.

The Drisco is located in a quiet residential neighborhood, so there are no commercial establishments in the immediate vicinity of the hotel -- just tree-lined streets and lovely homes. One of the closest restaurants, Garibaldi's, lies seven blocks southwest. It's a San Francisco institution and is known for delicious and inventive California-Mediterranean cuisine. Just a few paces further in the same direction is Osteria, a family-owned traditional Italian restaurant. In the other direction, eight blocks away, lies Rose's (mentioned above), a restaurant specializing in local California products but drawing creative inspiration from Italy. Just beyond Rose's on Union Street are dozens of additional wonderful restaurants. There are even more restaurants located on Sacramento Street 10-12 blocks to the West ((including Spruce, consistently rated one of the best restaurants in all of San Francisco) and on Fillmore Street six to ten blocks to the East.

One advantage to our location atop a hill in Pacific Heights is that every one of these restaurants are a downhill walk from the hotel. However, when it comes time to return, it's a very steep walk back up the hill. For this reason many of our guests choose to walk to their restaurant of choice and then take a taxi back. But if your'e fit and want to burn off that creme brulee you just had for dessert, it's a lovely walk both ways!

Many thanks again,

Darryl, the doorman, was a pleasure to come home to each night. Always had a smile on his face and greeted us with a "welcome back!" as he held the door for us.
The location of the property is great for two reasons, it is completely away from the hustle and bustle, yet it is located where all the great attractions are easily reached. With the California line of the cable cars right outside the front door, nothing is out of reach.

The associate checking us in gave us a great overview of the area and some useful tips based on the type of trip we were seeking to obtain. Upon our arrival back into the room after dinner, we found a comlementary bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries from the staff at no cost to us. Throughout our stay, we found the staff to be extremely accomodating and welcoming. I stay at 15 to 20 different hotels a year. Altogether, I have stayed at well over 100 different hotels, and I have never felt as welcomed and appreciated as I did at the Omni San Francisco. A wonderful experience, and I will never stay at another hotel in San Francisco.

As a former San Franciscan, I return often both on business and to visit friends and find it easier to stay at a hotel when I do. There are many fine hotels in The City, so for me, the way I'm treated by the hotel staff is the defining reason for me to return. The customer service I received by every staff member at the Omni was exceptional. At a time when poor customer service seems to be the norm just about everywhere, and many people have become resigned to it, the Omni is definitely doing something right.

In addition, the room was clean and comfortable, the bed was exquisite, room service (while pricey) was delicious, and I was able to open the window a bit to get fresh air (important to me). As a Select Guest member, I received free internet (few hotels offer this benefit) as well as morning beverage service.

Omni will be my hotel of choice from now on.

So, she offered for us to check out the room and then she can accomodate us if its too noisy for us. We decided to keep the room. In early morning we did hear some honking and sirens from the street. If you are a very light sleeper, you may want to request for a room inside. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay with Omni. Also, they offer complimentary drinks ie. coffee, tea, juice or soda deliver to you room in the morning.

We just stayed here for 3 nights over Memorial Day Weekend. They only charge half price for overnight valet parking on Friday and Saturday which was nice. Parking in this town can be expensive. The service at this hotel is top notch and as good as I have experienced anywhere including Four Seasons. We arrived late on Friday night and Kendra at the front desk greeted us with a smile. She was super friendly, curtious, and even helped us find a great place to grab a bite at 11PM just a block away. The staff here goes out of their way to make sure you feel comfortable. Lex at the conceirge is a wealth of knowledge and gave us some great tips on things to do in the area as well as some super restaurant options. There is a free walking tour on Saturday mornings that leaves from the Omni at 10am (check to see if that is all the time). We had a great tour of China Town and it lasted about 2 hours. It was super convenient meeting in the lobby for the walking tour.

I was concerned about the location in the financial district when I was first considering options for lodging. However, the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor for the Omni kept bringing me back. The location is actually excellent as many reviewers have commented. The bus and cable car lines are right out the front door. Cabs are everywhere and easy walking distance to North Beach and Nob Hill.

The rooms are recently updated and very quiet. The beds are comfortable and there is a good size desk with wired and wireless internet. My only complaint would be the wireless service was spotty and slow. I chose to plug in my lap top with the provided wire connection and then I was good to go. The bathroom was updated and spacious.

We had a free morning beverage and newspaper included each day. The beverage was delivered everyday exactly at the time we requested. The juice was fresh as was the coffee and cream.

I would highly recommend this hotel whether for business or leisure. The combination of updated rooms, quiet location, public transportation, and excellent service put this on the top of my list!
I plan to stay here again when we come back to San Francisco.

We really enjoyed our four night stay here over Memorial Day weekend. We were in room 1505 which was quiet, spacious, and clean. The king bed was huge and we loved the bedding. Turn down service and handwritten notes from housekeeping were nice touches as well.

The hotel bar was expensive, but the pour was easily a double or triple so we weren't too upset. The area is dead on weekends since it is the financial district, but the proximity to the Market, Union Square and North Shore makes for a nice and central location. There are two top notch restaurants literally around the corner ( wexlers and wayfarer tavern).

My only complaint was the shower. The tub appeared to be relined with vinyl or plastic and I slipped several times each showeron the slick surface no matter how careful I was. A non slip mat would have been nice. I did not mention it to the hotel, so I'm not sure if they would have done anything for us.

We definitely will stay here again. Make sure you join the frequent guest program, wifi is free even if you are a basic member.

The hotel is obviously old, but it is well kept up. The place is in no way dingy.The place has a very European feel to it. For location you can't beat it, right near Union Square.So much is just a short walk and if you are going farther afield, you can catch the Cable Car on Powell not even a half block away or walk, (or take the Cable car) to the Powell Street turnaround and catch the Muni or Bart lines. Yes, some rooms are on the small side, like mine, and yes, my window view was a brick wall, but I was never kept awake by traffic or the sounds of the city and spent most of my time out and about so no real issue for me. No AC in the room, just heat, but there is a ceiling fan and on high, with the typical Bay Area Weather this was sufficient. Two minor things that were lacking. No coffee maker in the room, but coffee and tea are in the sitting area at the end of the hall towards the front of the building. The other minor issue is the ice machine, well, it is really just a small freezer on the 4th floor with an ice maker in it with a big container to catch the ice. Worked fine, but often the ice available was low due to the amount of time it took for the ice to build up in the catcher. I did not partake of the wine and cheese offerings in the evening, but I saw the spread and it is quite nice. All in all a great experience with only a couple of minor issues, but well woth the stay. Highly recommend the Inn At Union Square.

The staff couldn't have been more helpful in recommending restaurants, attractions and transport advice. Ann on reception is an absolute gem. The manager was also charming, and hosted free drinks and nibbles every evening which is a great opportunity to chat with other guests and exchange ideas. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a boutique hotel.

What good is a review unless it gets down to specifics? With this in mind I hope readers find the following information useful.
1) This is a very small, homey hotel (~30 rooms) a half-block from Union square on Post St. A terrific location, and across the street from the Westin St. Francis - the other end of the hotel spectrum (ie very large, very pricey). Location is 5 Stars. Easy walk up the hill from the Bart with immediate access to public transportation.
2) Great staff - very responsive - very personal. 5 star attention
3) Rooms - here's where it gets dicey. It's a 6 story hotel with guest rooms on floors 2-6. XX1 rooms (ie 201, 301, etc) are adjacent to the stairs and next to each floor's small common area. Breakfast and the wine/cheese/fruit evening bonus are served in the common areas on the 3rd and 5th floors, with ice available on the 2nd and 4th floors. That said, I stayed in room 502. Had we not been early risers, the noise from the breakfast area probably would have been problematic. I can't imagine what it would be like in room 301 or 501. In addition, (assuming all XX2 rooms have the same layout as ours), room 502 is tiny. I mean really really small. The bathroom is closet sized and the shower enclosure would be literally too small for anyone larger than ~180 lbs to bathe in comfortably. My daughter stayed in 503 which was almost twice the size of 502, had a full sized bathroom w bathtub, yet cost 10$ less than ours. I would strongly recommend avoiding 301, 302, 501, and 502 when booking at the Inn. Honestly, they shouldn't charge the same amount for the XX2 rooms as they do for the full sized rooms down the hall. My daughter's room was 4 stars, and ours was 3.
4) Views - none. Nonexistent. Didn't bother us however if you want a view, stay elsewhere. 0 stars.
5) Breakfast - typical juice/sweet roll/fruit/cereal/bagel/hard boiled eggs continental fare. Nice to have. You're around the corner from Sears fine foods if you want a big pricey excellent breakfast. For us, what the Inn offered was more than sufficient - and since it's included in the room rate, a nice perk. 5 stars.
6) Wine/cheese in the evening. Again, very nice - social - and included in the room rate. We enjoyed it each nighht. 5 stars.
7) Finally - the rooms don't have air conditioning. This is generally not needed in San Fran - but on the other hand I don't know how comfortable the rooms would be during a heat wave. There are ceiling fans with multiple speed adjustments available.

Would we stay here again. Yes. Would I make sure to avoid the XX1 and XX2 rooms on the 3rd and 5th floors - absolutely!

Typically San Francisco interior, the staff were incredibly friendly, approachable and helpful. Special mention to Anne and Omar who would go above and beyond to ensure you have a great stay. They were also very informative about the San Fran area and recommended places to go and eat. The room was very spacious and comfortable. The location is also prime, being in the heart of San Fran just on the corner of Union Square. Do not have a bad word to say about the Inn, seriously consider staying here if you're visiting San Fran. Oh and don't forget the wine and cheese everyday at 5pm. Thanks for a great stay!

The breakfast was very nice especially the pastries, although the place was a bit small. Our room was a good size and very elegantly decorated, we felt like we were in a Paris boutique hotel. And the wine reception in the evening was a good way to meet some of the guests! Can't wait to go back!

As usual, I arrived and ordered a drink. The bartender looked at me with a blank expression and was rude (never experienced this before at any four seasons). Second, they placed my son's bed under the air vent, and I awoke to my son being congested. Third, when I asked to upgrade because the room they selected for us was too small, they hiked the price of the junior suites by 20% (more than the advertised price on the net). Again, I stay at the four seasons a lot and was shocked at the rude and essentially poor standards of this hotel. I will never stay here again and in fact will be checking out and staying at the Ritz while we end our short vacation in San Francisco. I am truly dissapointed with this hotel.

'A gem in the Four Seasons chain'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 15, 2012

We spent three wonderful nights at this hotel last February over President's Day weekend. This is an absolute gem in the Four Seasons chain and I believe it is without a doubt the finest hotel in the city of San Francisco. A beautiful property well located on Market Street less than a five minute walk to Union Square. The lobby and bar/restaurant areas are beautifully done in a rich wood finish, marble floors, and decorated with a gorgeous art collection. The rooms are spacious, serene, and relaxing with a wonderful window seat for lounging. And as an added bonus, guests are eligible to use the SportClub LA facilities free of charge. The service is truly special - when we checked in, the hotel upgraded us three room categories so we were on the top floor in a large room with a great view.
I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to returning. Thank you Four Seasons San Francisco for making our visit so special and memorable!

I realised i would not be able to handle spending 4 nights there and called the front desk to find out if we could upgrade to a larger nicer room. They offered us an executive suite for $150 more per day which we accepted and they had the suite ready for us in about 45 minutes. It was definately worth it as the living room was large and the bedroom more spacious with better decor and a larger bathroom. The bathroom was not the nicest looking and had just the basics but the bedroom and living room was beautiful. I was very pleased and our stay there was quiet enjoyable. We had dinner at Seasons restaurant, it is a beautiful restaurant with excellent service. Although the prices are relatively high (around $50 for a steak without any side dishes), my husband and i both ordered the rib eye and it was undoubtedly the most delicious steak we had ever eaten! We decided we would have dinner there again 2 days later as the food was so good however when we called that evening for a reservation were told it was closed on a monday :( Valet parking was available which cost $58 per night plus tax which i thought was a rip off. The spa menu was very limited and we did not both with any treatments as the choices available did not sound very tempting. The levels of service we received were excellent and the rooms were very clean.

'Great hotel'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 5, 2012 NEW

If you are looking for very nice rooms and great service, Four Seasons, San Fransisco is the place to stay. Great access to all of the public transportation and just a few blocks from the Powell St. Cable Car. Very nice bar and lounge area with a nice selection of wines by the glass or bottle. Service, service, service. Great!

My son and I have stayed at the four seasons in Dublin, Bev. Hills, Westlake, and others and I must say, our experience in San Francisco (May 25, 2012 - May 28, 2012) has been the worst! As usual, I arrived and ordered a drink. The bartender looked at me with a blank expression and was rude (never experienced this before at any four seasons). Second, they placed my son's bed under the air vent, and I awoke to my son being congested. Third, when I asked to upgrade because the room they selected for us was too small, they hiked the price of the junior suites by 20% (more than the advertised price on the net). Again, I stay at the four seasons a lot and was shocked at the rude and essentially poor standards of this hotel. I will never stay here again and in fact will be checking out and staying at the Ritz while we end our short vacation in San Francisco. I am truly dissapointed with this hotel.

The service at this hotel is excellent from pulling up in the taxi where they whisked our luggage straight up to our suite without asking our names (we had name tags on our bags). The luggage arrived before we did!
We ate breakfast each day in the restaurant and the choice and quality was very good.
The best thing was the quietness of the hotel, you could hear a pin drop in the corridors and in the room I have never slept so well in a city hotel.

Superb centrally-located hotel with extremely large attractive rooms.With its limited room count this is very much a boutique style hotel. The rooms are very quiet. The bathrooms are large and luxurious.Eating venues are SUPERB, as two of the best restaurants in Boston are located within this hotel. I was here for a family wedding and the staff could not have...

'Good but expensive'

Stayed here early June since it was convenient for a nearby wedding reception. Wedding party guests supposedly received a price break on the room rate, but even at that it was almost $300 a night + $42/day for parking. Rooms and service were very good - large rooms, free internet (always a plus), king bed, very clean, etc. Front desk... More

We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Commonwealth. It is within walking distance of Fenway and centrally located. There are two excellent restaurants on the property and a pretty cool bar. The staff were very helpful and nice. We will be back.

We took our graduating senior on a baseball trip and hit four ballparks in seven days. Our two nights at the Hotel Commonwealth and games at Fenway were definitely the highlight! The room was very spacious and the view of Fenway was an added bonus. We will definitely recommend the hotel and will stay there when we return.

My husband and I arrived at this hotel on the 18th May 2012 and immediately were made to feel most welcome. A warm atmosphere with very informative desk staff. The bell boy gave us an amazing amount of information including the lowdown on the Bay to Breaker run which was taking place during our stay and turned out to be great fun.The free wine tasting hour from 5pm was another added touch enabling you to meet other guests and obtain some wine knowledge at the same time in the warm atmosphere of the lounge with a welcoming open fire.
We had a beautiful room overlooking Alcatraz and the location of the hotel is perfectly situated for the city tour bus just round the corner. The hotel has an excellent restaurant on site which serves a mean chowder which was the best we ever had.All needs were catered for in the rooms e.g.coffe machine,dressing gowns,iron and board etc.We couldn't fault this hotel for anything.We notified the hotel that this was our silver wedding anniversary trip although the actual anniversary date wasn't in San Francisco but Yosemite where we travelled on to and Iris the concierge still had a bottle of bubbly and Giradelli chocolate left in our room with a card.

Adjoining on one side is a fantastic maritime history museum, for free, and on the other side, a wine tasting bar! For big kids and little kids. The decor is adorable, nautical theme. Heavenly beds, so comfortable, and the room is almost eerily quiet, or you can crank out the window and hear the sounds of the wharf. From our room facing the Cannery, we could hear a guy playing jazz music on the corner. Wonderful time, hated to leave!

The best thing going for this hotel is the location. We flew into SF for a weekend getaway, so with only 2 full days to see the city we wanted to be in the best possible spot. I say this is a good spot because you can catch the trolley nearby as well as one of open top bus tours around the corner so that makes it convenient. The hotel can charge twice what you'd pay elsewhere due to its location. The room itself was clean but quite narrow and small. And if you're unwilling to pay a king's ransom for a bay view, you get to look out your window at the other hotel windows facing you. The staff was courteous, but not overly so. The concierge we dealt with Kathy was very nice and efficient but what I'd expect from a hotel of this stature. I will be going back to SF in the near future for another long weekend but I'll probably skip the Argonaut now that I'm familiar with the layout of downtown SF. Not really worth the price if you don't care about staying so close to Fisherman's Wharf. I prefer getting off the beaten path anyway.

To be honest my wife had booked the hotel and I was already bored on the first day we had in Fishermans Wharf as I found it a bit to touristy ( If theres such a word ). This was all to change after having a chat with the Bell Boy Ernie. He gave us a map and told us about some fantastic places to go with thorough directions and also made a few calls to get us booked in a few places of which the food was fab. I would thoroughly recommend a stay here and try & catch up with Ernie who has immense knowledge of San Francisco in general.

The wine tasting is fantastic and the only way to offset the very high cost of parking.
The bar closed early meaning that there was no way to have a drink at the end of the day.
The room in the picture when we booked did not look the same as the one we were given.

This was our first visit to USA and this hotel was our first stop on the start of our journey around CA, AZ, and Nevada. The location is superb just around the corner from the cable cars and just a few blocks from the trams and hop on hop off buses. Across the road from The Ghirardelli Park, and opposite the Pier. The staff at this hotel are really helpful, friendly and efficient. The hotel is very clean comfortable with great decor. Our room was spacious with lovely touches of amenities, If you needed anything i.e. one day I required a mending kit to sew on a button I lost and within minutes one was brought to the room. The breakfast was good, we only ate once in the evening but this was also good. In the evening around 5pm there was a wine tasting reception, a lovely touch where one could chat to the other guest. If I had to fault this hotel it would only be that the bar closed early about 9.30pm, however there were plenty of bars near by to go to. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

The tour guide told us that it was built from bricks recovered after the 1906 earthquake and fire. Truth or legend, it is a nice story. The wine tasting hour was a nice touch and the sangria excellent.

There were fluffy socks and cute animal print robes in the closet. Having enjoyed complimentary socks and slippers at prime hotels before, we grabbed them and used them without thinking twice and missed the note that they were not free. For a luxury hotel, that was quite a surprise that we learned the hard way with a hefty charge on the credit card after departure. Pricey socks, but probably fit for a hotel that charges $46 nightly for parking. Another interesting detail was that the Kimpton loyalty profile was not linked to the reservation, so nobody knew about our guest preferences.

Room was big and nicely decorated, we liked the star-shaped pillows. Since the hotel was close to the waterfront, we were able to watch the 75th Golden Gate anniversary fireworks from right outside the hotel.

We recently stayed at the Argonaut and loved the hotel. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful and, while we weren't able to take our four-legged family member, we certainly enjoyed getting to meet all of the other well-behaved four-legged guests. The little chalk board near the entrance with their names on it was a cute touch, too. But, back to human matters. Since no one, or no place, is perfect, there are 2 minor criticisms. First, I'm not sure if we were in a handicapped room (there were grab rails all along the walls near the toilet), but there was no counter space in the bathroom. We had a pedestal type sink with a very small table next to it that held the soap, glasses, etc. leaving no room for personal stuff. The second complaint was that the air conditioner really didn't work very well. We were able to open our window to the cold SF air, but it was very noisy outside making it difficult to sleep, and there wasn't much of a breeze coming in because of the direction we faced. Minor issues that did not ruin our stay at the hotel.

While I would definitely recommend the hotel to others (we did and, in fact, one of our friends stayed there the week after we did based on my TripAdvisor research), we won't be staying in the area again - a bit too crowded and touristy. We saw several other Kimpton hotels in SF though that we would love to stay at next time.

Very close to Fisherman's Wharf, Golden Gate park, Muir Woods and Alcatraz and approx. 3 hrs from Yosemite National Park. There is also a great view from the roof. There are many great restaurants within walking distance or buy a Muni pass which you can use on the cable, trolley and buses to get around town. The staff was great. We had a clogged sink one night but it was quickly taken care of. My only complaint was it was a little noisy. Our bedroom wall backed up to the atrium/lobby where you could hear every word that was said outside. You could also hear noise from the other units and I understand that's because it's an older building. It also takes you a few nights to get used to the cable car noise because The Suites are located right on the Powell Hyde Cable Car route. Also if you are going to buy any groceries and carry them back to your unit remember the steep inclines of the streets. Over all we enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend The Suites!

We stayed at The Suites for 3 nights and could not fault the experience. Very easy to find and in an excellent location for Fisherman's Wharf attractions and restaurants. Also within close proximity for trams, trolleys and bus stops. The staff are very helpful and check in with Jason was quick and efficient. Before arrival, I requested a room on the third floor and were given Room 306. It was quiet and we didn't find the traffic noise a problem at all, and I am a very light sleeper. This is a time share property and so the rooms were a very good size and very clean. The furniture and fittings were of good quality with two flat screen TV's. The king-size bed was very comfortable with nice white bed linen. There is a good little grocery store just two blocks away. You can park your car in the garage underneath the hotel which is very convenient and we didn't have a problem getting in and out of the car park. Overall we were very impressed with The Suites at Fisherman's Wharf and would definately stay there again. Great value for money!

Had seen the photos of the view looking down onto Hyde St and out to the bay on Trip Advisor and we were lucky enough to score this room on the corner of the building with the fantastic view.
Was worried about the possible noise from the underground cable car mechanical stuff and sure, it is a constant noise you will hear till 1am (it's pretty much right on the dot when they turn it off) but for the view we had, it was totally worth it and hardly bothered us.

Balcony but no ash tray so a plastic coke bottle fixed that. However be very careful when out there - we got locked out one night with no phone! We were lucky that the concierge out front the super-swish restaurant across the road heard us calling out and notified the hotel staff, who came up to save us. Keep an eye out for all the luxury cars like Aston Martins, Maseratis etc. parked out front of that restaurant - for car lovers like us it was a total drool fest at night.

The staff were super-friendly, bended over backwards to help us and they even have this tic-tac-toe game going on between them and the visitors (you get a souvenir or little prize if you finish the board but we gave up after a few days - we had better things to do in this beautiful city!)
The bed was awesome, facilities superb and we even ate in a couple of nights. Not sure why a few reviews said this place was dated...
The best thing is it is so close to Fisherman's Wharf. Short walk (downhill thank goodness) to the cable car and Fisherman's Wharf, a bit of a longer walk to the shops, and the cable car/buses gets you to wherever else you want to go. The walk to get the ferry to Alcatraz is a nice long stroll down the wharf's main drag.
We will definitely stay at this hotel again when we return to San Fran.

We went up for the weekend for a family wedding. The wedding party had reserved hotel rooms at another location at a discounted price. We decided to try Suites because it was in our timeshare group. We were not disapointed. It was very close to were the wedding was taking place, but also in a centralized location. Close to the pier, cable cars and Ghiradelli Square, just to name a few. Makeing the reservations were a breeze. Check in was quick. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The suites were a nice size and very clean and comfortable. Modern furnishings. The elevators were small, but had a beautiful wide staircase which I chose to take. We have a large truck, and the parking spaces were a little small, but we got in and out ok. I would definatly stay here again. I don't really remember if it was noisy or not, so I guess it couldn't have been that bad. I would reccomend this place without a doubt.

To us the noise wasn't an issue as we wanted to experience S.F. and we did. This hotel is in a wonderful location and soon we were hopping on and off of streetcars and trams. Would we stay here again? YES. This was our first time here and to California and we loved it.

They suggested places to see and told us how to get there. The parking was no problem at all. Very reasonable for SF.

Rooftop view was amazing. A little chilly at night, so wear a sweater or jacket.

Cable cars start at 8:00 am. It was fun to hear the bells.

Will definately go back and stay here again.

Great find in Fisherman's Wharf area!

Pros:
Great location. Close to cable car stop, bike rental, restaurants, cupcake shop!
The room was awesome. Large suite which was HUGE, especially for SF standards!
The room was clean with a full kitchen and separate living room and bedroom with two large flat screen TVs and DVD player.
They have a parking garage under the hotel for $22.80 a day.
Friendly staff (most of them).
Good price for the size room and location. We paid $139 per night!
Nice rooftop deck with great views.

Cons:
I requested the third floor but ended up getting the first floor.
It sounded like the people were jumping around in the room above us. That was annoying. The courtyard can be loud and echo-y in your room if you have the windows open.
No A/C. I think it would get pretty warm in the summertime. Not a lot of airflow on the bottom floor because the inside widows open to the courtyard.
The windows have no screens on them. Kinda weird.
The parking garage is tiny and a parking spot is not guaranteed until you get there and check in. You have to leave your keys with the front desk anytime you are parked in there. Not a big deal because they are open 24 hours but it is a hassle when you are leaving and they are helping a customer check in. You have to stand there for a long time just to get your keys. Finally I had to start being rude and interrupting and asking for my keys. The process was annoying but I guess the garage is so small that they need your keys in case they need to move your car to get into a storage closet or something in the garage.

All in all we really liked this place and would definitely go back. Next time I would just hope to get the 3rd floor. I think that would make a big difference!!

I would easily give this a five star if only they would upgrade some furniture. The location is terrific, our room was so charming I was ready to move in! We had room 26 which was in the back of the hotel and very, very quiet. It was a large room with a beautiful gas fireplace (with a convenient switch at bedside!) The breakfasts are wonderful. We stayed here 3 nights, giving you a substantial discount) and every morning the hot buffet-style breakfasts were varied with an egg dish every morning and a different serving of meat (suasage, bacon). They also provide a complete array of pastries, croissants, oatmeal, etc. They do not skimp. They also have homemade cookies AND wonderful appetizers and good wine in the evening. Hot coffee and tea all day long. The public area for breakfast and evening appetizers/wine are wonderful with fireplaces, den-like atmosphere. BUT, again, the furniture is old and seats broken down. The small sofa our bedroom was a sleeper couch and very uncomfortable to sit on. The bathrooms are small but adequate. Very friendly staff.
A very minor point: one morning it was raining so we decided to use their fitness equipment consisting of a bicycle and treadmill. I think the treadmill was the first one made and you could not hear yourself over its noise which was okay since the TV wasn't working either. But in San Fran, you really don't need a fitness room!
One block away on Powell St. is a very good, very busy Italian restaurant called Uncle Vito's Good pizza and pasta with a very brisk take-out service. It's obvious that the locals love it. Don't expect atmosphere, just great food at a very reasonable price.

Not just dry rolls and cereal, they served scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes and excellent quality coffee. the king room was very large and comfy, but the room did get pretty warm in the middle of the night. We live in the bay area, but when we have a late night and don't want to drive home, we will definitely consider the White Swan or another of the Joie de Vivre hotels.

An added bonus is that cookies, tea and coffee are available all day and evening, and wine and snacks form 5 to 7 pm. I'll definitely go there on my next visit to SF.

Thank you for a lovely friendly stay in San Francisco. The room was great...really comfortable. It was a little dark but we can't complain as we never asked for an extra light! The readily available tea and coffee was very welcome after our mammoth walking ips round the city.

We recently stayed at the White Swan, and had a lovely stay. The hotel is close to Union square and Powell street, but just removed far enough from the noise and the bustle of the area. Also convenient walk to trolleys, buses, BART, and cable cars and the travel info center at Market and Powell. Our room was quiet at night, we heard no street noise at all which was great. It is an older hotel, but it is in excellent condition, our room was lovely in size and an excellent price for all that is offered. ( The one thing about an older hotel, I have never had a shower with as much water pressure, it was amazing - no low flow showers/water conservation here)

It was lovely having the bonus fridge in the room and the complimentary beverages of bottled water and pops. The breakfasts were much more then I expected, I was expecting more a continental cold breakfast, but every morning there was an egg dish, some type of sausages, fresh fruit and also some pastries and very good coffee. It was excellent. WE only attended on of the dinner time wine tastings, and we arrived a little late so there was only red wine, left, and weren't hungry, but there was very reasonable appearing food options even for this event. Some guests in the building came down after us and were very whiny about the no white wine left, but they arrived late, it was nearly over, and if you need wine so much go and buy some across the street at the market there. Also very good daily cookie treats in the lobby.

We arrived later then expected when we got to San Francisco, so it was around 10 pm before we got to the hotel and to go eat. The front desk offered us a list of recommended eateries in the area, which we did use during our stay, and enjoyed all that we tried.

I would not hesitate to recommend staying here and hope you have as lovely a time as we did.

Revelers from Ruby Skye Club at 2:00 a.m. and union protesters at 7:00 a.m. for an hour on a bullhorn. (To be fair, there was no noise for the next 2 nights of our stay.) Toilet was continuously backed up. We asked maintenance to come on 3 different occasions (which they did) and then we just gave up because it was never fixed satisfactorily.

To sum up, would probably try a different hotel on a future visit.

First visit to San Francisco with three friends, when at the last minute another friend decided to join. So we had five girls (ages 24-26) with six nights of luggage and one hotel room. Before booking a second room, we decided to check out the room we had already booked. To our surprise, space was not going to be an issue. The rooms were very spacious, as was the bathroom. The inroom nook with a mini fridge, counter, sink and microwave was also a bonus. The hotel is a short walk to all the shopping at Union Square. Also, transportation is very accessible from this hotel location. Picking up the F line on the train, or the Powell-Mason or Powell-Hyde cable car will quickly get you down to Fisherman's Wharf and the rest of the pier where you can take the cruise to Alcatraz, rent a bike to cross the Golden Gate or just take in the beautiful scenery. We had an awesome trip, and it all started with the Donatello!!! Thanks again!

The rooms were very spacious and clean with a refrigerator and microwave available. Bathroom was also large and well set out for our needs.

The only complaint I would have is that street noise does travel up to the room and sirens are very common during the night!! This is not really the hotels fault and you have to expect some level of street noise when you are in a big city.

All in all, we had a fantastic 3 night stay. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to come back at some stage.

We really liked this place. There are a few really nice touches such as Managers reception in the evening with complimentary drinks and complimentary breakfast (omelettes made to order also included).
Our room was on the 8th floor facing the airport and you could hear some of the noise of the airport, although nothing to keep you awake. There was also a constant noise from what I think might have been the air condition unit in the roof, again it wasn't loud enough to keep us from sleeping. The beds were comfortable and the whole place was clean.
Staff were very friendly and helpful. Internet is $10 per day and reasonably fast. Parking is $22 for the night although you can leave the car just outside on the street which is ok to do from 10pm to 10am (2 hour parking limit is in place from midnight until 8 am).
I could imagine that this is a good place to stay with family and kids as the rooms are a really good size and have two TVs.
Stay here - you can't go wrong.

The free shuttle service from LAX was on time and later (on our return to LAX) found to be very frequent. We checked-in early morning, well before published available time. We were greeted by a friendly receptionist who advised us that our room was ready.
In fact, all the staff should be recommended for their friendliness.

The room was comfortable and large with the only downside being that as a light sleeper I could hear the planes landing throughout the night. My wife however had no such problem. My issue was easily overcome as I moved into the lounge area of our room where waiting was a very comfortable fold out sofa bed. A quick close of the adjoining door and I was asleep pretty quickly.

The Embassy Suites offered a two hour manager's cocktail time from 5.30 to 7.30pm, and free cooked breakfast the next morning. A real bonus on both counts.

We had dinner in their restaurant and found the food quality and service to be very good.

We'd happily stay here again and will do so at the end of June.

Our stay at the Embassy North LAX location was a great one. We arrived a little early (before check-in time) and were advised that our assigned room was not ready and that we could leave our bags. When we returned at check-in time, I confirmed that we were assigned a quiet room due to traveling with our toddler. The nice desk clerk confirmed that we were on the 4th floor on the quieter side. However, she was reminded of a wedding reception that was taking place on that night and wanted to make things better for us. She upgraded us to a PURE room on the 7th floor that would not only ensure peace, but also a reduced allergen stay in our room. This would much appreciated as I'd been wanting a PURE experience so that I could decide if it would be something I'd pay for.....and I must say that those chances are probably greater now. The room was clean and spacious, which is so helpful when traveling with kid(s) so that they can move around and not be cramped. Breakfast at Embassy is always greatly appreciated as well. We had some extremely nice wait staff members who made sure we were well taken care of each morning. We were glad to give them a nice tip at the end of our stay.

Overall, great stay and highly advised!

Stayed 2 nights on the way home from New Zealand and glad we made the choice we did. Good location next to the airport but fairly limited in the dining choices within walking distance. Rooms were clean, well laid out and well appointed. Manager's party from 5:30 to 7:30 was great as was the complimentary made to order breakfast buffet the next morning. All this certainly adds to the excellent value the hotel provides. The complimentary airport shuttle really doesn't leave every 15-20 minutes but more like every 30 minutes so beware of the time you give yourself. That being said, the shuttle drivers were courteous and friendly.

The reason they are getting a four out of five is a result of the street noise and single pane sliding patio doors that did little to keep the noise of planes, idling buses, roaring motorcycles and partying in nearby rooms (with their patio doors ajar) from entering ours. It often sounded as if there was nothing between us and the street and save for our trusty earplugs, we may have never got a wink of sleep. Perhaps other rooms that face different parts of the block are quieter so if possible, ask for ones that do not face the street.

Would recommend and would return. Front desk staff are excellent and ready to please. Overall, very happy with the choice.

'Not what I was expecting . . .'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed May 29, 2012

For $259 a night! While the room and breakfast were very good, the hotel interior and exterior looked very much like a motel and not sufficient for the room price. The rate on this one is all over the place. If you can get it for less than $185 a night, I think it is a much better value.

One of the nice kitchen waiters there even made us fresh pancakes to order and they were delicious! The rooms are clean and very nice with a separate living room and bedroom  each with its own TV. The bed was great  nice clean, fluffy comforter and four pillows to choose from. There is also a small office off of the lobby with free internet access and a printer if you need it. It is located only five or ten minutes away from the airport and the shuttle (which they share with the Hilton) comes every 15-20 minutes. I would definitely stay there again.

The side we were on was on the street side and we could see the planes coming and going, plus hearing the traffic. But it was a plus, because it was nice to see that view.

I have stayed at this hotel several times in the last few years and have always been very satisfied, to the point of recommending it to others. My last visit changed that. Though I might still stay here (even knowing what I know), my recent experience has now made me cautious. First, the good from previous visits: decent rate; underground parking; airport shuttle; very good sized rooms and bathroom; indoor pool; breakfast included; and a happy hour. Now the bad from my last stay: we were not given the room that I requested (2Q), but given a king room with a sofa bed. Not our preference for our two kids, but we made do by asking for a rollaway to be brought up to the room. Problem was, neither the sofa bed nor the rollaway were made. I called the front desk to have them made up while we were out to dinner. Upon our return, nothing had been done, so I called again. A very nice person from housekeeping came up right away, but seemed confused that I would want the beds made with sheets and a blanket. I got the feeling that he thought I was supposed to make them up myself - uh, no, I don't think so. After that was absolutely the most terrible night's sleep because - and this is the most important thing you need to know about this hotel - our room had a sliding glass door that was not double-paned so no soundproofing NEXT TO LAX. Trust me, you need soundproofing here. I heard every airplane, truck and car that was anywhere near the airport. Just awful. No sleep was to be had that night at all. So, if you stay at this hotel, be sure to get a room on the side street with windows, not a sliding glass door. Previous stays we didn't hear the noise because we were on the quieter street side. Makes a HUGE difference. I was very disappointed that I was not given a better room since I had made it clear that I was a returning guest. I am very surprised that when the hotel renovated last year that their first priority wasn't to make all their rooms quiet. I live in an airport flight path and double-paned windows and doors are a must. Other minor complaints, the pool was way over chlorinated to the point that my teenage children said their eyes were burning; and the front desk was a bit disorganized, or perhaps just understaffed. I will probably give this hotel another chance if I happen to stay in the area again, but only if I am guaranteed that I will receive a room on the quiet side.

FORGET EARLY CHECK-IN: We took Amtrak from Seattle so after a 21 hour train ride we arrived at the hotel at 10:00 am with our luggage. They told us they would try to accommodate with an early check-in, all we needed to do is leave our bags with the bell captain and they will call us as soon as they have a clean room. We were told that there were a lot of people leaving that morning since we checked in on Memorial Day and most were checking out after spending the long weekend there. They finally called us with our room AT 4:00 PM, it's hard to believe they didn't have one clean room until 4:00 (the normal check-in time). I think it's because my husband didn't tip the woman at the desk that said she would call.
LOST LUGGAGE: When we did get in our room they couldn't find our luggage, apparently it was put into another room earlier in the day.
STEAKHOUSE: Was closed for Memorial Day, a little disappointing but understandable so we ate at Morton's Steakhouse and it was delicious.
BREAKFAST: The breakfast the next morning was nice but not worth he extra money to stay here since there are nicer less expensive hotel options.

Bit noisy though, we were on 7th floor and constant AC noise from other buildings rooftops, plus traffic noise. Breakfast good, hot and cold selection. Afternoon happy hour also very good. All the staff in hotel were excellent. No real complaints, although price of $179 during week and $199 at weekend PLUS taxes, was a little high I thought.

I am a reserve officer in the RSAF since decades. I have access to the MMC as a reciprocal member. I have just returned after a week with my wife here in a fireplace suite.
First of all, the building itself is a living museum. Many guests as well. When trying to make a reservation through the e-mail I am sad to state that it took quite a few including overseas calls until I received a response. The rate I paid for the room included a 85 sq m two room suite w bath and working gas fireplace. A generous full breakfast and a very generous free happy hour every evening between four and 6 was included, as well as access to the best health club in San Francisco, located on the premises.
So why not top marks? First of all, the suite has absolutely NO noise insulation. Probably not a problem for old Marines, but even I , who have mortar damaged hearing on one side, was forced to have earplugs, and to stuff the space between windows and windowboards with decoration pillows in order to get any sleep. Secondly, I must say I found reception cool. Also interaction w other guests. We did meet a couple of nice couples and chatted away two evenings with them but I have to say that most people just stared at me and my wife. She is admittedly beautiful, but the stares were not followed by smiles. I do expect the average Marine family to be on the conservative side, but found it sad to be judged like this, especially since I always have been a true conservative, as has my wife.
The leatherneck restaurant serves up decently priced food that Granny makes. If she is in a good mood You get good food. Breakfast is filling and adequate. Steff is efficient, although sadly not filled with smiles. The business room gives You access to computers for free which is good. The health club has a pool. but the ambience of the club is VERY much athletic. You swim Your laps. You do not hang around or lounge in a chair with a drink. Basically since You can't get anything else than water, there is one chair and no view except a brick wall.
The club IS historical, but for USD 400 including tax for a room I had expected more than sofas upholstered in plastic and unsmiling staff. And to those who wonder-yes we tipped every morning and every happy hour. Generously.
I would have LOVED to love this club, just as a do with my own, the Royal Air Force Club. Or the Muthaiga Club. Or any other great historic hotel like Raffles, The Eastern and Oriental, the Savoy or the Strand. I just didn't feel either welcome or valued. Except from the charming Leatherneck restaurant maitre'd, Mark Sokolov, and the kind barmaid Patty. For these two people, and for the Glory of the Marines, I give the place four stars.

The hotel employees were very nice, the FULL SERVICE BREAKFAST which is included at no charge is daily and AMAZING!! Breakfast is served on the top floor with great views of the city. Plus there were plenty of other perks, the location is perfect and there are laundry machines on two floors that you may use at NO CHARGE. Plus if you forget laundry detergent they have some for free at the front desk. I knew about the laundry machines in advance so I packed a couple of one time use detergent packs that I had picked up at CVS in advance. Aside from being dedicated to the marines this hotel is amazing and I would recommend anyone looking for a really great place to stay in San Francisco stay here. It's a beautiful building with great service and EXCELLENT amenities!

The distinctive interior, artifacts, and general Marine Corps historical atmosphere is overwhelming! Every floor has its own era or dedication memorials, Medal of Honor wall, Commandant's Hall etc. The complete buffet breakfest in the morning is fresh, hot, tasty and has a great variety. If you want only fruit, there is plenty to choose from, if you want good old "SOS" it is there for you. My glass of orange juice never got half empty, and the waiters and waitress's were "on it" . Clean, professional, and very much Marine Corps and/or military minded. The hotel concierge was VERY courteous, and helpful. He knew the area, the best places to eat, depending on what I was looking for, and when I needed to ship an item, he took it and when I got home, it was there, packaged perfectly. I cannot say enough about this hotel except that we currently have plans to hold our conference here every year! Support your military, and stop in if your are ever near the hotel, and if you are traveling, you MUST stay here, it will become your favorite!.

We were certainly not disappointed this time. The lobby hadn't changed at all, the wood was well polished, and the Marine momentos were all exactly where they should have been. The parking charge at the Olympic Club was a little higher, but the Breakfast Buffet was better than ever. The only detractor from an otherwise perfect stay was the noise coming from a private party on our floor. I probably could have complained and I'm sure the staff would have responded quickly, but I didn't want to bother, and my room was so comfortable that I really wasn't too disappointed that I wasn't sleeping. If you are an active duty or retired military member, or can otherwise join Marines Memorial, I encourage you to stay there just one night. You'll probably become a pilgrim like us.

If I could have fallen deeper in love with SF because of this hotel...I did! I love that the windows open; because the smell of the city is of flowers and clean spring air--delightful.

Finally, they have a wine tasting each night. Over three nights we had tastings from two wineries.

They do have a car service that works with them for the airport. It was only $5-7 more than a cab and much more comfortable.

Can't imagine a better-situated place for San Francisco. If the rooms were only a couple of feet wider (so that one person could pass between the bed and another person sitting at the desk), this place could price itself out of reach for many of us. Within walking distance of Union Sq., Moscone Convention Ctr., Museum of Modern Art, Yerba Buena Gardens, Chinatown, and the Ferry Pier -- and easy access to BART and almost any bus or trolley line you might want, including the F trolley over to Fisherman's Whart/Ghirardelli Sq. Since it's in the financial district, it's comparatively quiet at night (although Sutter-Street-front lower floors could be noisy on weekends), but as safe as you need for most purposes. Be sure to scope out the French bistros in the area and up the hill on Bush.

Although one would wish that breakfast were available truly in-house (there's a sign in the elevator that says "dining - mezzanine, referring solely to coffee and tea service), breakfast at the attached "Hecho" Japanese (-?"Mexican"?) restaurant probably counts from the management's point of view. However, it seemed a little funky and slow for my purposes, and most didn't seem to eat breakfast there (different story for lunch/dinner -- miso soup and sushi was fine). For myself, I was more than happy to have thick toast, fruit cup, frittata, and amazing drinking chocolate at Bread and Chocolate next door, reading the paper and people-watching at the corner of Sutter and Kearny.

Very pretty little garden terrace on the 3rd floor, with "jogging path" (short!) and lovely plantings.
Only other wish: some nibbles and for non-drinkers,non-alcoholic beverage for wine hour (a little chintzy to suggest that we take snacks from our honor bar for nibbles - even just plain popcorn wouldn't cost the owners that much).

Earlier this month, I received a TA message from The Galleria's manager inviting me to give his hotel another chance. Coincidentally, we had just finalized our flight plans ( we plan early!) for our trip this Christmas and was checking out hotel rates.
After exchanging a few emails, he resolved my complaint and I promised to withdraw my previous post. While I look forward to our stay and will post a review thereafter, I am encouraged that the hotel has taken steps to see to customers' issues and in my case,it's never too late.

The rooms are a really good size, and conveniently have a fridge to store water/snacks in. The staff are all really friendly, and the DVD collection at reception is handy for a quiet night in. We had the complimentary breakfast a couple of times, but can highly recommend Sears on Powell for breakfast and dinner. Hold fond memories of this place, as I proposed to my wife here!!

4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 30, 2012 NEW via mobile

I chose this hotel for my vacation to San Francisco based on the trip advisor reviews, and they were right on the money. With AAA, we spent less than 200 per night. It was a great value for the location-- right on north/south and east/west cable car lines and right by Union Square. Since we were out exploring the city most of the time, it was perfect for us. Clean, comfortable, quiet, no frills. What else do you need really? It was a great choice and I wouldn't choose anywhere else in hindsight. We took the cable cars to fishermans wharf and the ferry building, took cabs to fancy restaurants, and found some great spots nearby, too. It's walking distance to union square shopping and there are convenient grocery and convenience stores and pharmacies within a block. Terrific choice. I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't a "wow" factor-- just a good value.

Posh Bagel a favorite for breakfast two blocks away. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. It's nice to have confidence in your hotel. Even though you only may be there to sleep, you want to be assured that where you are staying is safe, clean and comfortable. The Orchard Hotel was all of these and more. Only two minor fixes: needs flat screen TV and more water pressure in the shower.

The front desk staff was very friendly and the room was very clean, updated, and had all the amenities one might need. To top it off, the price was less than what I would have expected for a hotel of this quality and location. There is Valet Parking available, but there is also a large parking garage one block away if you prefer to park yourself (the cost is roughly the same for each parking option). If you don't have a car, it is very easy to get a taxi right outside the hotel.

I'm happy to say that what I found was a very clean, well-appointed, friendly, conveniently-located hotel. The location is extremely convenient to public transportation, stores, restaurants. While Union Square is a very appealing area, on previous business trips I've really struggled to get a taxi to the office in the morning. Happily, the doorman out front was extremely helpful on this front (better than other doormen I've relied upon) and when he couldn't get me a taxi right away, he had a car and driver at hand who could get me to work at the same price as a cab. It really made a difference for me. The hotel staff were very pro-active, professional, helpful and polite. My room was extremely clean and "fresh" and it was nice to find the bathroom had a make-up mirror. My only disappointment was that room service wasn't available the Monday night I arrived (the restaurant was closed, too) but I think that was an unusual circumstance (but worth confirming if you plan to arrive on a Monday). Finally, as I'm a very light sleeper, I was thrilled to find that my room was EXTREMELY quiet. Overall, an excellent stay and I will definitely stay there in the future.

The Orchard Garden hotel is excellently located, approximately 5 minute walk from Union Square and right next to Chinatown Gate. There are plenty of options for dining within easy reach. The cable car stop on Powell Street is only a very short walk from the hotel.

The hotel rooms are modern and spacious with the biggest bathroom I have ever experienced in a city centre hotel. The bed was super comfy and very large! Check in was very straightforward and I found the staff to be helpful and friendly. We booked the Orchard Garden on a pre-paid rate and received a significant discount. Our room was on the 9th floor, at the back of the hotel so experienced no street noise from busy San Francisco.

Orchard Garden hotel is 30-40 minutes walk from Fishermans Wharf or a 10 minute cable car ride.

Two tips for anyone visiting San Francisco. Book your trip to Alcatraz in advance online and take the first boat of the day thus avoiding the crowds. Book tickets to see the San Francisco Giants play (can also do this in advance online) and thus experience real America!

We live right across the bay and know the Hotel Vitale to have a good reputation and an excellent location. We decided to treat ourselves to a Giants game and a night in the city for my birthday.We got a great last minute rate so we just head across the bridge!

I have stayed at other JDV hotels and so far, they are my favorite. They just get it right. Friendly staff, trendy and an attention to detail without being stuffy.

Our city facing room was quiet and spacious. The bedroom and bathroom was immaculate and nicely appointed. Top quality linens and towels and the bed was comfy.Having read reviews about the noise, we thought we hit it on an empty Sat. night. But...... were surprised to see that the hotel was actually full. We did not hear a sound from inside our room.

It was great to be just walking distance from AT&T stadium and the game was great (Go Giants!). Boulevard, one of the better restaurants in the city is just across the street. We then strolled through the ferry terminal in the morning. The breakfast in the restaurant was also well done.

I would love for the parking to be less than $48/night but the bell staff was helpful in suggesting other options. They knew all the regulations for parking in the area. This is one of the downsides of city hotels.

If only we can make this our routine every time we want to see a ball game!?!

Chic modern hotel with a small but functional gym. Good size room. Free coffee in the lounge in the morning and free wifi. Good location and nice spa. Far too cold to make good use of the roof top terrace, this was one of the selling points when choosing the hotel. 20 minute walk to Pier 39

My partner and I debated long and hard before booking the hotel for our San Francisco vacation. Would the Hotel Vitale worth its premium price over similar hotels located nearby? We decided to go for it, based on our positive experiences with the Joie de Vivre brand. In the grand tradition of damning with faint praise, I have to say the Vitale was good. It was not, however, great, and as a result I am left to wonder if it was really worth the cost.
When we checked in, we specifically requested as quiet a room as possible. The woman at the desk said this was no problem, and said that we'd been upgraded to a higher room class. We discovered that our room, which was on the hotel's 3rd floor, faced Mission Street and was directly above the hotel's driveway. More problematically, there were quite a few patrons of the bar/restaurant who were congregated outside this area, and their conversation was all-too-clearly audible from our room. I called down and was able to get another room, although it was a "downgrade" (and did not appreciate the front desk person arguing with me about where the noise was coming from--does it really matter whether it's noise from the restaurant or the valet area? All that I cared about was that it was impossible to sleep!). This new room faced the interior courtyard and was definitely smaller than the first, but it was quiet. Bath amenities were nice (Lather brand), and the room was nicely appointed.
I had some trouble getting my "Joy of Life Club" perks--I had emailed someone from the hotel well in advance of our stay to let them know we were members, but there was no record of this on our reservation when I arrived. I mentioned it again at check-in, but no amenity was issued. Nothing showed up the following day (during room cleaning or check-in) and finally, on the last full day of our stay, I called down to the front desk to inquire. The person I spoke to had my amenity sent up, but I feel that there should have been more follow-through on my initial inquiry, rather than my having to constantly inquire about this.
The gym was very small (the size of a guestroom, no windows) but it was clean and had nice equipment. The bar/restaurant's hours seemed oddly limited (I expected that this would be open all day during the weekends, at least, but this was not the case) and the noise that emanated from it (when we arrived at 10:30 P.M. on a Thursday) was alarming--I can't imagine that it's not audible from the second floor of guest rooms, and any rooms that overlook its patio area would probably hear this as well.
The hotel's location across from the Ferry Building was a huge plus in our book, but might be inconvenient for those not interested in this area of the city. Additionally, the financial district (which the hotel abuts) is a ghost town on the weekends, so if you're looking for nightlife, this might not be the place to stay.
Overall, I expected more.

When in San Francisco, I typically stay at The Kimpton Palomar, but decided to give Hotel Vitale a try due to a last-minute special on Hotel Tonight.

After I booked the room I called the hotel to see if they have rooftop hot tubs or just soaking tubs. The woman I spoke with told me not only did they didn't have a rooftop hot tub, but did have a pool and sauna--I was ecstatic! I called a few friends up who live in the city and told them we will be having drinks poolside at the hotel soon!

Upon arrival to the hotel, no one greeted us or said they would be with us soon until I finally asked one of the bell boys if I was in the right place to check in. While this would be expected at a cheap roadside hotel, I was a little surprised to be left hanging at a hotel of this caliber.

After getting our room keys, I excitedly headed to the rooftop to check out the pool. It was non-existent. I wandered around the property in search of the pool and sauna without any luck. We finally headed down to the front desk. The woman working told us there that the property did not have these amenities, but we could use a complimentary guest pass at the YMCA to use their hot tub and sauna. Looks like rooftop pool drinks were off. I was a little bummed, but didn't want to let it ruin our vacation, so we headed to our room to get settled.

Our room was beautiful, that is, until I noticed the loud screeching noise coming from the "kitchen vent" outside our window. I called the management to see if there was any way to switch rooms, but the manager I spoke to said the hotel was fully booked and we could switch rooms the following day.

I feel truly sorry for anyone who paid full price for this room, as I awoke early in the morning to a screeching humming noise when the kitchen opened and only got about 5 hours of sleep. I called the front desk again and they said they could switch us at noon to a room on a higher floor or could charge us to move to a less noisy oceanview room.

I'm anxiously awaiting the room change to get away from the noise. Whatever you do, DO NOT stay in an interior-facing 3rd story room unless you are very heard of hearing or deaf.

I hate leaving a review this negative for a Joie De Vivre hotel, as I've had so many great experiences at their hotels in other cities, but they really could use some improvement here. Unless you are staying in one of their large oceanview suites, I would say you're much better off at the Palomar.

I adore Hotel Vitale! I received an upgrade to an Urban View Room during my most recent stay which includes a huge soaking tub. I was in room 730 which was right across from one of the suites where they have meetings and events. There was an event one evening in the room that went until 8pm and was a little noisy so request a room away from these meeting rooms if you need quiet. Be sure to join the Joie de Vivre loyalty program so you can enjoy your welcome gift when staying at this or other Joie properties. Everyone on staff during my stay was super friendly and make me feel very welcome. My only concern about his hotel is the limited equipment in the fitness center and lack of windows in the fitness center. You can get a free pass to the YMCA which is very close to the hotel or a pass for $10/day to the Bay Club Athletic Center which is a little less then a mile from the hotel. Hotel Vitale has a calming effect on me each time I visit.

1 of 5 stars Reviewed May 24, 2012

Pros
-- Nice decor
-- Nice amenities
-- Great location for public transportation access (not a fun location though)
-- Overall clean and well kept


Cons
-- So loud. It's 3 a.m, and I am writing this review from my hotel room. I've been here 6 nights, and I haven't gotten a decent night's sleep for six nights. I would like to leave. Now. Please. I have a "city view" room, which is a view of buses on a dirty street. Between the buses decompressing and idling outside my window, the drunks on the street, the people in the building that I can hear peeing and drunkenly screaming, and the random noises from the patio above, I really have not gotten any peace or quiet.

One of the issues is that there is a rooftop garden that is open at all hours. So if you are in one of the many rooms under the rooftop garden, you get to hear everything that happens on the garden. This includes people walking up and down a metal stair case, the random drilling and machine noises, crap falling off the building (what IS that?), etc. If you get a room under the rooftop gardens, you know you're in a cheap room. You got screwed.

The walls are very thin. I can hear everyone above and next to me when they use the restroom.

And, since I'm up, I thought, why not watch some TV? Let's see. I can watch reruns of Seinfeld or a cable news channel.... Or Seinfeld. Or a news channel. They maybe have 10 channels, and MSNBC doesn't even come in well. Fox News comes in real well. Splurge a little, Hotel Vitale, and get some real channels so that people have something to do while your hotel keeps them up all night.

The hotel staff never responded to any of my questions about noise. They'd listen politely and then do nothing - not even call back. So don't bother with them; just get a different hotel.

The Hyatt Embarcadero is just around the corner. I am going to try there next time I'm here.

The other reviewers are correct about the hotel restaurant. It's always packed. It's very loud and obnoxious.

Overall, this is just not the right hotel for a business traveler.

Stayed here May 2012. In a good location at the Bay Front with views of the Bay Bridge at the foot of the financial district overlooking the Embarcadero. We had requested a Superior Room with a Water View and were pleased to have been told that we were upgraded at check-in. Thank heavens we were, the room whilst large and clean was definitely in need of refurbishment, especially the bathroom where there was no separate shower cubicle, just a shower over the bath and a shower curtain. If this was an upgrade, what are the rest like? The view on the other hand was excellent.

The hotel appears to be geared up for conferences as there were at least 3 during our 4 day stay. The hotel bar at night was uncomfortably loud and full as a result and was not somewhere you would return to relax in after a long day. Interestingly, it was quiet one afternoon and we tried to sit down and have a soft drink while catching up with the English papers only to be told that they were shut and wouldn't serve us and we were asked to order through room service. Speaking of which, room service whilst efficient failed to fill the fridge every day we were there which was annoying given that I had to call down for drinks as we were avoiding the hotel bar!

Note also that concierge is not 24 hours so if you you want to book a meal or excursion or general advice make sure you do so during office hours!

This hotel is not cheap, nearly $450 a night to stay plus taxes. It is definitely overpriced for what you get. A small Holiday Inn springs to mind which if you are happy with a Holiday Inn fine, it is not what I thought I had booked and not what I wanted. I would not return.

The room could not have been nicer, view of the Embarcadero and the Bay Bridge. Amazing bathroom, great amenities.
Points to consider: when I checked in they asked if I would like a newspaper? I asked for the NYTimes. I never received the newspaper. I was going to mention it to the Front Desk, but decided not to -- after all, why should I?
The second day, I need to have laundry done and there was no bag? I called downstairs and it was promptly delivered.
Similar occurrence, ordered breakfast and asked for bottled water -- no water?
Sounds petty, but to me these are things that make hotels GREAT.

We stayed here for 2 nights recently, the hotel was in an excellent location. Just around the corner was a large Westfield shopping centre with Bloomingdales and all the big names.

We look the Bart underground from SFO airport to Powell Street station. It costs $8.10 per person for one way. The hotel is just a 2 minute walk as you exit the station.

The room was nice although a little small. Free WiFi was a plus, sign up for Kimpton rewards before you go, only takes a few minutes. We were located on the 5th floor, this is where the restaurant, gym etc was located.

I found that when I got home the hotel had charged my credit card for the room although it was already pre-paid. I contacted them and they apologised for the mistake and refunded me. The staff were very friendly, nothing was too much trouble.

I would defiantly recommend this hotel and would be happy to stay here again.

From the moment I booked our reservation at Hotel Palomar, I felt like a welcomed guest. Rachel Wang, the guest service representative, contacted me by e-mail to acknowledge my room requests and to answer some questions about transportation. She was so engaging and knowledgeable I was quite enthusiastic about our stay.
Our arrival at the hotel was made simple via BART from the airport with a direct stop to the hotel. For those who are not accustomed to an urban environment you may be a bit nervous about the kinds of people who are wandering around the hotel area. While it may be off putting it is really the state of the environment throughout San Francisco - this situation is not peculiar to this hotel. The front desk staff welcomed us with a salute to our anniversary and with a professional air that was down to earth and inviting. The staff was fully knowledgeable of the hotel amenities and gave us specific information about our stay. They were also always at our disposal to offer directions to and from our restaurant choices and AT&T stadium.
The bar and lounge area in the hotel is vibrant and welcoming as well. Our bartenders Brian and Sarah were professional, but also friendly without being intrusive. Brian had expert knowledge of his bar and introduced us to several wines and cocktails that we will definitely try again. The free happy hour of wine and appetizers is a nice perk offered at all Kimpton Hotels and we did enjoy the one at the Palomar as much as the others we experienced in Chicago, San Diego and DC.
We will return to the Palomar for all these reason - great staff, great service, great atmosphere, great location to public transportation. We will be back to celebrate other occasions!

Although the hotel is at a busy intersection the soundproofing is excellent (I was on the 9th floor and barely heard traffic noise). The staff front-desk staff are uniformly helpful and friendly; one exception was a doorman who tried to convince me to take a town car to the airport when I asked him repeatedly for a taxi. I always prefer having a coffee maker in the room for first thing in the morning. Although there is coffee service in the 5th floor lounge, it would have been nice to have a Keurig in the room. This hotel is a wonderful alternative to the huge, sterile, and anonymous Marriott just across the street.

From the welcome email prior to arrival through to check-out, the staff were friendly, helpful and professional. We were given a lovely room on the 5th floor which was quiet and well positioned. There was a coffee maker, animal print robes and a well stocked mini-bar in the room. The bed was very comfortable with quality linens.
I joined Kimpton club prior to arrival, so internet access was free and there was a wine gathering each evening - a lovely touch.
Breakfast was decent if a little slow. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel but were told by others that the food was excellent.
There was even a lovely dog in reception for me to pet in the morning before walking the short distance to the sights, the hotel is in an excellent position close to cable cars, shops, public transport and sights.
I've stayed in more luxurious hotels but overall, this is a great hotel, excellent value for money in a prime location with the best front desk staff I've encountered.

Just got back from our week stay in the New England and could not wait to review this place.

The only sad thing about this place was that it was our first hotel stay of the trip and set the bar way too high for any other New England hotel to match. We took the red eye flight in from Los Angeles so when we landed at Logan at 5am we were zombies. It's really easy to get here from Logan via the "T". All you have to do is take the Silver Line to the South Station and it's a short walk up Atlantic (We wish we knew this when we first got there).

Knowing that our hotel check in wasn't until 4pm we wondered over to the hotel to simply check our bags and wonder around town. The front desk was extremely gracious by seeing if there was something they could do to help us out and gave us our 4pm check in at 7am!

Once we got to our room we were quite impressed with the size of it. It was very spacious and very comfortable. I've read some of the reviews about the style being old fashioned or outdated in this hotel but after checking it out it wasn't old fashion. It was a bit more turn of the century and Art-Deco in it's design. Sure it wasn't one of the modern design places like the Intercontinental a few places over but I come from LA where every hotel looks like that. The Boston Harbor Hotel gave me a little more of a New England Feel and for that I am very grateful.

When we finally crashed on the bed we laid down of one of the softest most comfortable mattresses we've ever slept on in our lives. It was like sleeping on a cloud.

I took advantage of the Fitness Center and was very impressed with it. I loved the salt water pool and was impressed with the locker room which had a sauna and amenities for me to shower, shave and start my day.

The hotel also sits on the harbor with a beautiful boardwalk at it's back door.

This hotel was truly the hotel highlight of our trip and cannot express how pleased we were with our experience. No other hotel was able to live up to this hotels experience. If you have the dough to shell out for a little luxury, make the Boston Harbor Hotel your choice. We're so glad we did!

I stayed at the Boston Harbor a few weeks ago, as a colleague booked it first and I choose to stay near him rather than book at a separate hotel. My first room was so loud that it seemed like the elevator control room was in my hotel room. There were constant sounds of people talking in the corridors, and even a dog barking away around 1 or 2am. I got about 3 hours of sleep that night. I got moved to the 'quieter' tower. I was taking a conference call from the room around 3pm and could literally hear the jangling keys and rustling of a garbage bag by one of the housekeepers walking by. I then checked out and moved next door to the Intercontinental. I would never re-book at this hotel until they figure out some sound attenuation. It's sad, because it is classic Boston with beautiful views and good restaurants, and a stellar location. I have stayed at the Liberty, Intercontinental, Ritz, Beacon XV and W and have not had any sound issues to this extent, and I have spent roughly 25 nights in hotel rooms in Boston over the last 8 months.

The hotel is in a wonderful location on the harbor. It's convenient for both Freedom Trail tourists and financial center business travelers, and easily reached by public transportation (from Logan, take the Blue Line to the Aquarium stop.)

I had a junior king suite with a very nice city view. It had a separate living area with a work desk, television, sofa and chair, the very comfortable king-sized bed with another television, and a bathroom area. The bathroom amenities are higher end and even include liquid laundry soap. There is a minibar with some directions on how to use the refrigerator for your own items.

There is both wired and wireless Internet. I wasn't able to get the wireless to work, but the wired was fine. Both are complimentary. A business center off the gift shop has computers, printers and copiers. You have your choice of newspapers, rather than only the customary USA Today.

The health club is excellent with a variety of cardio machines, weights, a pool, and even personal trainers (for a fee.) A number of spa treatments are also available.

The staff is uniformly friendly and helpful. Your wake-up call comes from a live person, not a recording. There is an evening turndown service (but no chocolate on the pillow!)

As a road warrior, I'm not looking for a great hotel experience. If I get one that's a bonus, but I'm more interested in small things that make the time away from home less painful. Two things missing here:
1. Convenient check-out. There's no statement under your door; you'll have to go down to the desk to check out. That was fine for me this trip, but if there were a line, I'd have been running late to my meeting.
2. No in-room coffee. I'm not sure why upscale hotels find coffeemakers beneath them, but many do and this is no exception. I use the coffeemaker for morning coffee, instant oatmeal for breakfast, maybe a cup of tea in the evening, and not having one makes a difference. On this alone, given the choice, I wouldn't stay here again. There are plenty of other options.

We planned this vacation, pretty much based on a review of the Ritz San Francisco Club level being one of the top of the country.
The hotel is beautiful, no pool, old classy feel to it.
The rooms are spacious and well appointed.
Check in was appropriate , I had called for an early check in since I was driving from Napa and had early reservations to see Alcatraz. They did have a nice room ready for us. I am a platinum Marriott member, no upgrade was offered or was available, but this was ok since I had the room early.
The club level staff never really acknowledge us much. The presentations at the club were nice and varied but repetitive. I have stayed in many Ritz club levels before, this was not the best. I did like that they had their own bar but most times was not staffed.
I did not feel staff was very accommodating, I hear people asking for mimosas in the am and being declined.
Location was just ok.
We ate at their restaurant parallel which was good.
Overall, a good hotel, most definitely not best club level.

The rooms are ok, the appointments great, but bathroom very poor for a Ritz, like the shower and bathtub together. The staff is good without being great like other Ritzes, except the gentleman who checked us in who was great. They have a service to pick you up or drop you off that's very seldom available. If you bring a car, parking is around 72 including tax. Not great for a Ritz, better stay close to Union Square and where it is flat.

My wife and I get up to San Francisco a few times a year for some R&R. Generally we are Four Seasons junkies and stay there or the Grand Hyatt, but this time we got a deal at the Ritz and decided to stay there for four nights. We knew that the experience would be different - we expected that the Ritz would be more old world charm and elegant compared to the trendy modern style of the Four Seasons.

First I do want to acknowledge some good aspects of the Ritz: the hotel was spotless and in perfect condition. No chipped tiles, missing grout, dinged floorboards that you see at even some other five star hotels. The hostess/waitresses at The Lounge and the bar at Parallel 37 on Friday and Saturday nights were fantastic - perfect discrete yet attentive service. Every concierge that we talked to during our stay was knowledgeable and helpful. The car valets were very professional and helpful.

But we had some issues. First off, the service in the restaurant side of Parallel 37 (their main restaurant) was very spotty. Some, like Reinaldo, were perfect. Others not so much. In fact at one breakfast we finally gave up after waiting 10 minutes for the bill and simply got up and left. Really! I can't remember the last time I've done that at even a Burger King, let alone a Ritz. The restaurant itself, as well as The Lounge, is a bit of a conundrum. The hotel is old world style, yet the restaurant and lounge have been renovated to a modern style - coincidentally very similar to what I'd expect in a Four Seasons with the sleek lines and chillaxing music. Somehow it just didn't fit. One minute you're in an ornate marble lobby, the next you're surrounded by sleek wood and metal. Huh?

Another issue was with housekeeping. We tried and tried, but somehow our schedule must have perfectly conflicted with room cleaning and the evening turn down. Even though each day we were out of the room from 8-10 and 11-4, then 6-8pm. Finally we called and asked for at least a special turn down so we'd have some clean towels. At other five star hotels they uncannily know when you're gone - presumably some spies in the lobby or something - and the room mysteriously gets cleaned each day regardless of schedule.

The hotel itself is at the top of a steep hill. Only a couple blocks from the Union Square shopping area, but those two blocks are MUCH more difficult than the two blocks from the Four Seasons to the same Union Square, let alone the Grand Hyatt right off the square. One odd thing, that perhaps just brings out the hotel snob in me, is that at no time was there a doorman to open the doors for us. Of course we can do that ourselves, but I guess I've come to expect it.

The rooms are nice - perhaps a bit small but that's ok. No separate shower, which I like. The courtyard view rooms are very quiet - almost too quiet! Some noise in the hallways in the mornings, but nothing significant.

Don't get me wrong - it's a very very nice hotel. Just not what I expected from a Ritz, with the level of perfectly attentive yet discrete service I've come to expect at any and every Four Seasons. Which is where we'll stay, again, next time.

Resturant service was fairly poor in both occassions. With the restaurant semi empty (only 5 tables were occupied) we waited over 25 minutes for two bowls of fresh fruit. Whas fumming when waiter instead of moving to my right side to place my spoon on the table, he just came fron the left side - across my face to place it on the table. Folks I understand training is time consuming and perhaps expensive but this is the Ritz-Carlton.
Next day we had a similar situation in the same restaurant, when I asked for a latte it was served on a tall glass mug but the spoon was too short to stir the sugar. When I asked the waiter for a taller spoon, he just gave me a nasty look and response " we do not have any".

My family and I have spent a week in San Francisco and booked A ONE Bedroom suite for our last night in San Fran because we knew we would get a great nights sleep in preparation for our long flight home. When I booked the room I explained what we needed a suite with a door separating the bedroom. When we arrived we did not have that room , if it was not available at booking just say so there are plenty of other hotels that we could have booked. As a frequent Ritz customer I am very familar with the suite I requested. The club level was disappointing as well. My family and I went up at 900 for the late night desserts and found most things gone and as we sat there a young lady took away the containers of cookies. Also not a soul even asked what we might need on the club level. I sometimes think that people who complain on here simply cannot be pleased however now I understand that sometimes the service you expect someplaces is simply not delivered. My family actually ate dinner at the HYatt down the street when the Suggestion by the Ritz had a long wait for dinner. I should have thought to call but I am not the Bellman at the Ritz Carlton I am just a paying customer that will know cancel my future reservations at other Ritz properties i have made for the fourth. What a POOR ending to a wonderful trip to SF.

We stayed here as a family of 3 for 4nights, and found it to be ideal and well worth the money. We had a superior studio, meaning separate bathroom, kitchen and living/sleeping area. The living/sleeping area was creatively arranged, with a Queen murphy bed which we put up during the day, to allow sufficient space to have a little living area with sofa to watch tv or relax without feeling like we were in a bedroom. The mattress on the Murphy bed was very comfortable and felt like a good firm quality mattress. With a 21month old, it also helped to have that 'extra' space for him to play when we weren't out. The kitchen was modern enough and clean, with full size refrigerator, 4burner stove and oven, dishwasher, coffee maker, toasting oven, cutlery, crockery etc and breakfast table with 2 bar stools. Bathroom was clean, although a little older, and perfectly fine for taking a bath. There is a small wardrobe/cupboard area in the short hall between the living room and bathroom, which we actually used to put our toddler's crib (taking off the front sliding doors) - this effectively put him in 'another' room, which enabled us to watch tv and have conversations at night once he had gone to bed. We were in room 509 which faces to the back of the building and into the central part of the building. It was quiet and we didn't really hear much noise at all outside our apartment, except the neighbours coming home late at night, as their door way was right next to ours....but no real noise between apartments. In fact, we hardly saw anyone else except in the lobby during our stay.

The other guests we did see, tended to be either permanent residents, or longer term stays such as business travellers, with an occasional short stay like us.

As per other reviews, this is not a traditional hotel, with concierge, restaurants, room service, and other hotel amenities you might expect, but reception was there during the day and into the early night, and were especially helpful and friendly - more so than that i have experienced in many other hotels. Nichole at the front desk was always smiling, and offering to help us. The entrance lobby is secured from the street front, with code access, and inside is a lovely classic clean heritage feel throughout. They even have the original elevator with latch gate door inside, which was pretty cool. The building is heritage listed, with excellent maintenance evident throughout. There is also a laundry in the basement, with washer and dryer for easy self service.

The location is Nob Hill, as defined by Wikipedia and other San Fran maps, and we found it safe enough to walk through. It is about 3 blocks north of the Tenderloin area, which reception kindly marked on a map for us, and suggested not to walk in that direction. There was nothing else that way anyway, so it wasn't a problem at all. We could walk to Union Square, to the West, East, and North, to Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown etc....without worrying. There are occasional homeless people around the streets nearby, but we found that throughout the city area anyway, regardless of the neighbourhood. We took the bus about 3 blocks away, walked down to the cable car at Powell St about 4 blocks away, and were able to get everywhere in the city in one easy mode of transport or on foot.

Regarding price, we booked directly on the hotel's own website, which seemed to be about the same rate as that we found anywhere else on aggregator/discount sites.

Overall, we had an excellent stay here at the Steinhart Hotel, and would highly recommend it for a family or anyone who wants the convenience of feeling at home, in a good central location - but without needing the luxury pampering of a hotel.

Location is good, seemed a bit rough in some areas nearby, but only a ten minute walk to the city centre and 15 minutes down to the pier.

Would definitely stay again!

One of the best all around lodging experiences I have ever had. We stayed here for five nights and we could easily have stayed a month. The Steinhart balances apartment-style living with hotel convenience at a very affordable rate. Our suite of rooms at the back of this venerable building on the 4th floor was quiet, stylish, and spotlessly clean. We had four large rooms, including full kitchen, dining room, living room and bath. This all for about $200. per night. Although the hotel does not have a cafe, room service or other conventional amenities, the immediate neighborhood offers these services in abundance. Turn right and there's a well stocked market; turn left and find Cup a Joe, a wonderful urban coffee shop/cafe. The location boasts easy access to tourist enclaves like Union Square and authentic residential settings like Pacific Heights, or you can trek through the panhandlers of the Tenderloin to SOMA. Rent a car around the corner at Hertz for $40.00 per day, all in.

The kitchen had everything we needed although we mercifully ate most meals out. Wireless was free and though the two large flat screens are not high def, they have tons of offerings. The wire cage elevator is fun and there are two set of stairs that anchor the wide, pleasant central hallway.

Maid service is once a week, but the suite was well stocked and we'd rather have the privacy.

I recently booked a studio apartment at the Steinhart for a week in December, based on solid reviews on this site. Not only was I not disappointed in my choice, but my expectation were exceeded far greater than I could have even asked for.

If you read some of the other reviews here you will notice the resident manager Dimitar's name all over the place. The reason for this is the guy is exceptional. Upon arrival there weren't any studio rooms available, so he instantly upgraded me without flinching. He was full of information about San Francisco and was not only pleasant to deal with, but gave all the time needed. Nothing was a stress for this guy and there were no pressures at all in my stay.

Obviously the room is one of the most important things, and the room I stayed in was a one bedroom apartment. The room was clean and spacious, with a large comfortable bed. There was a small TV in the bedroom and a large flatscreen in the lounge. The room had a full kitchen, complete with stove, oven, microwave and fridge. The bathroom was spacious also, with plenty of full length mirrors. Upon arriving in my room I unpacked all of my clothes into the closet and drawers, as this place really felt like a small apartment one might live in. I really felt at home here and it was such a shame to leave.

One thing that people need to realise before they decide on making their booking is what type of building they want to stay at. If you are after a hotel with doormen, room service and the like this place is not for you. The Steinhart is a gorgeous apartment complex that provides a stay in a great part of San Francisco in a contemporary apartment. The elevator is classic old school and the lobby is beautiful. There are laundry facilities downstairs should you wish to use them. This place is the perfect place to stay if you're looking to go about your business at your own convenience and don't require all of the minor things that hotels do. I noticed that on my trip I stayed at hotels, but lived at the Steinhart. This was such a big difference.

The location is another thing that this place has going for them. They're located in a quiet street, only 8 minutes walk from Union Square. One can easily walk to Union Square and bypass the Tenderloin completely (which is 2-3 blocks away). SF has a big homeless problem, but thankfully there weren't any homeless people around where I was staying. The Steinhart still has double security doors with keycodes (which they give you upon arrival) to add that extra layer of security. Across the street is a great coffee shop if you want to grab a morning coffee and bagel. Three doors down is a grocery store, which is perfect to stock up the full kitchen. Next door to the grocery store is Aces bar, which is open until late 7 days and plays all major sporting games.

My stay in San Francisco was one of the greatest experiences of my life because of the comfort, location and friendly staff at the Steinhart. I'm already clamoring to head back to SF and there is no doubt in my mind I will stay there again.

Highly recommend this hotel, it is close to everything and has great cooling/heating. For those Gay and Lesbian travellers... it is quite close to the Castro (5 minute taxi ride) and Dimitar just great and makes you feel right at home...stay there...I'll guarantee you will love it !

5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 5, 2012 NEW

This was the first hotel stop fro 3 nights on our Californian holiday driving down the Pacific Coast Highway from San Francisco to Los Angeles. What a great choice! The ground floor of the hotel was being refurbished and there were many areas of the hotel unavailable. The staff were exceptional, we received an excellent welcome from the moment we stepped out of the taxi. Our cases were whipped away somewhere and we walked into the makeshift reception cleverly hiding all the building work behind them by curtains. The hotel is perched on top of a tall building in the city and starts at the 38th floor. Our room was on the 44th floor, a huge corner room with the most magnificent bathroom. There was a huge window over the bath tub from where we had a great view of the bay, coit tower, Fishermans wharf and Alcatraz Island. If you stretch you could also see the Golden Gate Bridge. The rest of the room had windows all the way round with additional views and to our surprise all the windows opened! We were able to have real fresh air in the room and a great view all round Excellent! The room had a very comfortable large king size bed with quality bed linen and excellent pillows, a large sitting area, large desk, power sockets everywhere, three telephones, a safe, free water, fully stocked mini bar. The bathroom had a separate shower cubicle with an excellent shower, one large basin, a small bath tub with hand shower, quality fluffy towels and Molten Brown toiletries. Our cases arrived seconds after we entered the room and the bellman showed us around our room.

There was only one restaurant available on the 2nd floor of the hotel and this was the bar, main restaurant and breakfast area while the refurbishment was taking place. I am sure by the time you go to this hotel it will be fully functioning. The food in the restaurant was excellent. Breakfast was cooked to order and very good indeed. The waiting staff exceptional.

The concierge were also exceptionally helpful and particularly professional. They had booked our Alcatraz trip before arrival and it all worked perfectly. We asked for a restaurant booking on the second evening and left it totally to them. On our return to the hotel after a day out in the city a note was left in our room that the restaurant was booked and the complimentary hotel car was at our disposal to take us to the restaurant and collect us at the end of the evening. We are particularly enterprising and love making our own way around cities by public transport where possible but to have this offered to us was a pleasant surprise - Exceptional service!

There were no leisure facilities available but the hotel had arranged the use of a nearby gym and pool, we did not have time to use them at this hotel.

The hotel is situated seconds walk from Market Street from where you can walk to all the shopping areas, Union Square, Westfield etc. It is so easy to get around San Francisco, the buses are easy to navigate and of course you MUST travel a cable car. Take it UP the hill and walk down (if you can!) They run up Powell Street.

This is the first time we have stayed at a Mandarin Oriental hotel and if this first experience is typical of the service we will certainly be back.

A GREAT first hotel stop on our huge trip.

'Spectacular view!'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 28, 2012

I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental, San Francisco in a 2012-year renovated room. The view of the city from your hotel room is beyond compare, I can only imagine what a view of the water would have been like; however, I will note that from my vantage point, I could see a little bit of the water from my room as well. This hotel has spectacular views! Walk through the hallways of your room/suite floor and you will see views of both sides of San Francisco (city and water). Location wise, the hotel is situated where you could take a brisk walk to Chinatown, Union Square (shopping), and the Ferry Building. The area is pretty quiet after dark since the hotel is in the Financial District (I think).

While you check-in on the first floor, the rooms/suites start on Floor 38. The lobby was still being renovated at the time of check-in. I did not particularly care for the set up of the Front Desk and Concierge in such close quarters to each other (they share the same curved row together). While checking-in was easy, as a first time guest, nothing was shared with me about any hotel amenities or package benefits that came with my booking. Ask if you have any questions.

During my stay (while renovations are still in progress), there was a business center available to guests and complimentary access to an offsite, very nearby, gym.

Room: What I immediately noticed about my room was that the three windows actually opened. Yes! The hotel has a very robust A/C and heater, which is always appreciated as well. I stayed in a room with two double beds; therefore, there was no sofa/table. The room featured an in-room safe, closet, dresser, working desk with two chairs, three telephones and a full master bathroom with separate shower and tub. There was no in-room coffee-making machine; although complimentary coffee is served in the morning in the lobby. The bathroom was great, especially the shower. Bathroom amenities are from Molton Brown. Lighting controls in the bathroom are one setting  either all on or off  but there is plenty of light. On a nice day, when it's sunny, open the window blinds and there is plenty of natural light. You can also draw the sheer blinds to filter the sun. Note: If you open the windows on a windy day, the blinds will go all over the place. From my vantage point, you can easily see your neighbors in the other wing of the hotel, so use the blackout shades accordingly for privacy. Light in the room is sourced from a floor lamp, two sconces by your bed, a table lamp and a few recessed lights in the hallway and over the work desk. All in all, lighting was sufficient but lighting controls from your bed are not intuitive  you have to walk to your front door to turn off the hallway lights. I really like the neutral colors in the room, it has a very contemporary feel.

Room service: I ordered twice from in-room dining. Dinner: (2) entrees, (1) appetizer, and (1) side  with all taxes, service charges, delivery fees, came up to almost $80  pretty standard for a hotel of this caliber. Breakfast was close to $70 dollars for two, again pretty standard. Food fare was okay  but the service was excellent. The food was brought always brought up within the quotes times (usually 25-30 minutes). I wanted to order wonton noodle soup, which was on the menu but was informed that it was no longer being served.

Service: The hotel graciously brought up a birthday cake for me  which is always a nice gesture from a hotel when you're celebrating a special occasion. You could cut four generous slices from that one cake alone. While staff was generally pleasant throughout the property  from the doormen to housekeeping, I experienced some service issues with the Front Desk. What matters is that everything was resolved by the time I checked-out. And, to be fair to the hotel, what I considered 'issues' is subjective. To preface this statement, I vary my expectations based on the circumstances  i.e. leisure or business travel (who is paying), the brand (MO is comparable to Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, and the St. Regis, all which have a presence in San Francisco), and price (entry level rooms during my stay started at a little shy of $400). In this case, I had high expectations of the hotel.

Lastly, I noticed some, or maybe all, of the Concierge staff had the iconic golden keys on their uniform  so they are part of Le Clefs d'Or, a prestigious Concierge association. I did not request any services but I trust that any and all requests would be taken care of.

'Mandarin Oriental SF remodelled'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 13, 2012

The remodelled Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco continues its excellence. The lobby and downstairs lounge/bar have been completely renovated and updated to an understated calm elegance, and this is also reflected in a renovated room suite I enjoyed during a recent business trip. The service in every department is personal, prompt, warm and professional, as always. I am hooked.

We wanted a special celebration for our 25th wedding anniversary in San Francisco. I was drawn to the property because of their reputation for customer service, but mostly because of their incredible views! However, I was slightly reticent to book there due to their renovation in progress. I did call and speak to their staff who reassured me that the only difference that we would notice was their temporary lobby and that everything else should be as though no renovation was going on. Wow, was she correct! From the moment we walked up to the hotel to the moment we left we were pampered and treated to a wonderful experience. Every single staff person was not only very efficient and professional, but they were all incredibly warm and hospitable as well. It is my impression that it is a happy staff and they all seemed very proud of their hotel. We had a beautiful, newly renovated room on the 45th floor overlooking the Bay. The gorgeous room combined with the incredible view was breathtaking. The welcome tea was just lovely. We had a fantastic celebration dinner in Silks, with an equally high quality staff and delicious food and wine. Breakfast in Silks was also top rate with incredible attention to every detail. We thank everyone there for their kindness and hospitality. I would highly recommend the Mandarin Oriental San Francisco to anyone who values excellence in customer service combined with beauty, calmness and serenity. By the way, just prior to our check-out, they closed the temporary lobby and opened their newly renovated lobby, which is gorgeous. We are looking forward to eating in the new restaurant as soon as it opens!

First into a Bridge-to-Bridge room after renovation/refurbishment demonstrated a few problems with the room that indicated the staff just hadn't checked things well enough before letting the room. In the bath, new wallpaper was only partially adhered to the wall and sloppy grouting between tiles was messy and obvious. A floor lamp wasn't properly assembled and it leaned in a corner between windows that bracketed spectacular views. The gym was not reopened yet, but that was not indicated on the hotel website. The property location is excellent for city business, but a few blocks away from popular shopping/strolling. Staff courtesy/knowledge, room service and room amenities were excellent. Given the price is at the top, until the kinks are worked through there are better values at other of the luxury properties in the city. Suspect these problems are likely to be resolved soon.

The hotel is very centrally located in manhattan with most parts being within walking distance or a small taxi ride. The hotel itself is pretty well maintained with well-sized rooms and good sized bathrooms. It is a business hotel and hence not very fancy (if thats what you were expecting). Overall a good experience that I wouldnt mind repeating.

The concierge desk is right by the elevator, and they greet you as you go by and ask if they can assist. Join Omni's select guest program for free, and you get free room wi-fi and morning beverage on the spot.
I go to NYC often, and I have found the place where I plan to stay in the future.

Omni have the makings of a good loyalty program and they have joined a global alliance, but their recognition of various membership levels , personal preferences and the consistency of the benefits is patchy.Issues once raised were addressed by management efficiently.

The location is good, easy walk to the subway.

I guess I must be upfront about this: we love staying at Omni Hotels.This was our 25th stay at an Omni, (according to their records). We stayed at this Omni for our 33rd anniversary 'celebration' trip to New York City. My wife and I have stayed in just one other hotel in NYC, the Times Square Hilton (back on New Year's Day in 2010). For this anniversary weekend visit, we decided to stay at the Omni Berkshire Place, since we've tried the Omni Hotels in Boston, New Haven and Washington DC (and loved them). The rate was fairly expensive - it is New York, after all - but we were upgraded to a junior suite that overlooked Madison Avenue (you really couldn't see the street from our windows, but we knew it was down there, as we heard them re-paving the road at night - and yet, with the drapes closed, the sound was such that it did not impact our getting a good night's sleep).

Everything at the hotel was what I expected from an Omni: check in staff was efficient, helpful and friendly. Room service was great. the fitness/exercise room (with a view of St. Patrick's, no less) was adequately equipped.

Long story short, we had a wonderful stay at the Omni Berkshire Place and would recommend it highly if you are interested in staying in this part of Manhattan.

While the Omni was a nice hotel, it is only slightly nicer than your average Holiday Inn, and using the "star rating" system, it is certainly not a 4 star hotel -- maybe 3 1/2 stars?

The rooms were clean, but fairly stark (and not in that new stylish, minimalist sort of way). The beds were nice, but not spectacular. The bathroom was adequate -- yes, the floor was marble, but it was small and didn't make good use of space. We stayed in a room which was a "Premier Room", one up from the lowest "Deluxe Guest Room". I would expect a bit more for a higher priced room, but I guess it was the few extra square feet of space. The built-in wall unit barely provided enough closet space. The lobby was small and nothing special. The hallways were bland and dimly lit.

The staff: Always courteous, but certainly I would not classify them as "friendly" or "helpful" -- and it's not like they were that busy. The cleaning staff, valet staff, and luggage staff were the most kind and helpful. The front desk crew was...well...just there.

Location: Good if you're interested in shopping on 5th Avenue or Madison. A block from Saint Patrick's Cathedral. The Omni is walkable to Central Park, Times Square, and the Theater District IF you have a good pair of shoes and don't mind a bit of a hike.

Overall, it's a nice hotel, but I question its high rating. If you can get a room for the mid $100's, then it's a bargain. Anything over $200 for the first two levels of rooms and you may be disappointed. Why? Because for the same price in NYC, you can get many nicer hotels in better locations.

During our recent vacation, my husband and I spent a few days in Boston first then went to New York for a few more days to revisit our favorite places. We'd never stayed at the Omni so I was really unsure of what to expect. We love old (but nicely renovated) NY hotels and have previously stayed at a number of other properties in Manhattan -uptown, midtown and downtown. NONE have compared to the Omni Berkshire Place. We were so pleasantly surprised by this hotel! From the outside, it really doesn't look like much -standard facade, no porte cachere, nothing really remarkable to make it stand out. But inside....what a treat! After checking in with the terrific front desk staff, we were thrilled with our room. We stayed on the 14th floor and for the first time ever in NY, we never heard a peep from outside -and there was even the Turkish Day parade going on! Our room was beautiful, big (especially by NY standards) and the bathroom even has a wall-mounted, lighted/magnified make-up mirror -what a great amenity! The concierge staff was fabulous -gave us directions, advice and generally were super helpful. And Lenny the doorman, best in the city! He always made sure we were headed in the right direction and smiled and greeted us every chance he could. In the future, we will never stay anywhere but the Omni They did what most hotels fail to do -they made us feel so welcome and at home.

'Nice Remodel and Friendly Staff'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 3, 2012 NEW

I first stayed here when it was the Hotel Montecello and couldn't come back on my next trip until the remodel was done. The rooms were updated but still maintained the historical hotel charm. Bathrooms were nice and big and the staff were very friendly. The best part of this hotel is its location - only 1/2 blocks to the cable car station on Powell and downtown by a lot of the stores. I would have given this 5 stars except the amount of noise at night comes through the windows for the rooms facing the street. I suggest they update the windows on that side. The staff did warn me though prior to check-in and I appreciated that but I ended up with the last room. :)

The wifi was fast and that is helpful as a business traveler.

'Fabulous Boutique Hotel, Even Better Staff!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 28, 2012

My husband and I booked this hotel through Hotels Tonight for one night while we were in San Francisco. We arrived well before check-in time but the staff still allowed us to go ahead and get settled into our room. When we booked the room, there was no guarantee what kind of room/bed we would receive. Still, we got a lovely room with a king-sized bed. We immediately decided that we wanted to stay another night and the staff was so helpful in arranging that. Never, have I ever had such WONDERFUL customer service. I travel often and stay in many different hotels but nowhere have I ever been treated with this level of care. From hailing a cab, to greeting us by name, the staff catered to our every whim like we were the only guests staying there (although I know we weren't from seeing people come and go). The rooms were freshly remodeled, the beds were very comfortable, and the heat/AC worked well. The location was also great being very close to the cable car/bus stops and lots of shopping. I only wish every hotel we stayed at was this nice.

(I recommend taking BART from the SF airport; 45 mins, $8.00 each, easy-peasy to get to within the airport).
And once you arrive at the hotel, you will likely be greeted as nicely as we were. Great staff, engaged and friendly.
Our room was a corner queen, with plenty of room for two people and a nice, clean if smallish bathroom. Water pressure was good, no complaints. Amenities were class-act as was the Joie de Vivre welcome card and sparking water "gift" left for us after we arrived. This was a true surprise since I'd just joined the Joie de Vivre club prior to making this res. Bed was very comfy, with a duvet.
Other sincere pros: def enjoyed the evening glass of wine at the bar; in fact we enjoyed that bar a LOT, even after the free glass of wine was gone. It is a cozy, slightly dark library with books everywhere, as well as great art on the walls. The bar menu was good; recommend the asparagus soup and grilled cheese. I flipped through a New Yorker cartoons anthology for an hour one night just hanging out. Very serene spot.
There was also a delicious breakfast buffet--$14.00 each but that included everything: juice, coffee, pastries such as croissant, very fresh sliced fruit, waffles, toast, eggs, bacon--good quality, home fries (California-style with red peppers), much, much more. The day before we'd eaten at a former fave, the Cafe Mason just around the corner, which wasn't a good as remembered, and cost more than the hotel's delicious breakfast the next day.
We missed meeting Maximillian, the pug, because he had "gone off shift" and wasn't working during our stay. However, we did get to see the Golden Gate Bridge's 75th birthday fireworks!

I try to stay at Rex Hotel whenever I am in San Francisco for business, which is every few months. The hotel definitely has character.
The location is hard to beat as well. Since San Francisco is not densely populated, I recommend staying in Union Square area since it is always lively even late in the evening. On the other hand hotels towards Tenderloin area would not be a good choice if you like to take a walk around. Rex Hotel is on Sutter Street which is close enough to Union Square but far enough from Tenderloin.
I like to order breakfast in my room. It also serves as a wake up call.
Wireless internet in the room works decent enough. Did not slow down during the evening where many people connect to it.
I only stayed as single person in their room. For a couple maybe ask for a large room as their rooms are not very big.

4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 29, 2012

I stayed at the Hotel Rex last week in an Executive King room. My previous experience with the chain was the White Swan Inn, which was fabulous, so I had high expectations. There was a large convention in town and my choice of lodging was very limited.

While the ambiance was very different from the WSI, I appreciated the cleanliness and simplicity of the furnishings. The decor was very masculine, with dark woods, colors, and classic finishes. The bed was SUPER comfortable (one of the reasons I like this particular hotel chain). The bathroom was a little dated, but not unreasonably. Everything seemed clean and in good order. My room looked out onto a lovely courtyard. I skipped housekeeping for a couple of days, which landed me a $5 Library Bar gift card each day. The service was adequate, but not as warm and friendly as I had hoped. I got the whole "I'm from San Francisco and, thus, better than you" vibe... Hence, the reason for docking one star: the evening wine "hour."

At most other hotels I've stayed at, including the WSI, an evening wine reception allowed you to sample a variety of local vintages. The first evening I tried the wine reception, the bartender was particularly unfriendly--again, giving me the "why are you wasting my time?" attitude. He asked what I wanted, I told him, he poured me a glass, and I sat down. I also ordered a cheese plate ($11) using my $5 gift card. After I finished my (unsubstantial and boring) cheese plate, I went to ask for another glass of wine. The bartender says "only the first one is free." I was taken aback, as I've never heard of a "wine reception" with a one-glass maximum. I thought the guy was joking, but he gave me a small "splash" and was done. I was staying on a greatly reduced rate; had I paid full price, I would have definitely complained to the manager. Note that this hotel also does not offer a continental breakfast, but does have a breakfast buffet option at $14 (a little spendy for breakfast by my standards).

While the location (near Union Square) and room were very good, I would recommend this place only if the White Swan Inn were totally booked.

Luckily they suggested the Hotel Rex which was actually much closer to my daughter's college dorm. Moved her out of the dorm and stayed at the Rex two nights. We were treated very professionally by a kind and friendly staff. They took care of our car with all her stuff in it. They asked her how she liked the school and the city. I thought that was pretty cool. We had a quiet little room on the top floor facing away from street. It was tiny but who hangs out in the hotel room when in San Fran? Comfortable bed, cute bathroom (love the shower head), crazy small elevator but fits the charm of the building. We hopped on a bus on Market and went to the places we chose for our short time left in the city. Max is so cute!

'Great location, great atmostphere'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 9, 2012

person found this review helpful

This is a fantastic traditional townhouse hotel - dark wood, paintings, books and and palms - two minutes from Union Square. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There's a lovely library bar downstairs where residents are offered a free glass of wine in the evening, which means people congregate there and there's a really good atmostphere, that you don't often get in town hotels. The room was spacious and comfortable, and well decorated. I'll definitely stay there again when I visit San Francisco.

We found this place on Trip Advisor and could not have been more pleasantly surprised with this inn and its sister property, The White Swan. First of all, the location was perfect. Situated just outside of Union Square, the hotel is in a great spot for walking to many restaurants, bars, and shops. As well, the cable car is a short block away. Reception was friendly with home baked cookies and a bowl of fruit in the lobby. Complimentary water and soft drinks were also readily available. We arrived in time for the afternoon wine and hors d'oeuvre which were lovely. Our first room was acceptable, although tiny. We stayed the first night, but because we were carrying extra luggage to attend a wedding, we did not have enough space and requested a room change.
We were moved to the White Swan, their sister property and treated with the same warmth and amenities. Our room there, was fantastic! A gas fireplace, dressing room and wet bar for a small upcharge. This was clearly our fault for reserving badly. We could have spent a month in the second room which was great.

Quaint alternative to a large hotel chain. I enjoyed my stay here and despite a few quirks, everything was lovely. Petit Auberge has many upsides: the staff is very friendly and genuinely seems to want you to enjoy your stay. The breakfast buffet is quite good, with alot of nice options. I especially enjoyed the San Fran sourdough bread and the fact that they had actul plain (no sugar or chemicals) yogurt each morning. Every afternoon there were house-baked cookies, which was a nice touch. The breakfast area is adjoined to a lovely sitting room and to a patio, which looks lovely for the warmer months.
Some of the quirks: each room has a gas fireplace, which is the only source of heating in the room. So, if you want to be warm, it has to be on, but then it's very bright in the room. Not too much of a problem, since I always travel with any eye mask. The staff didn't really understand my request to NOT change my linens every day, despite me leaving them a hand written note. Not very Eco-minded of them, even though there is a placard in the room asking guests to re-use! I resorted to leaving my "privacy please" door hanger on for the rest of the trip. 
The hotel is small (only 28 rooms) and has a quirky, verging on shabby-chic decor. I personally liked this, but fussy folks may not. The building is quite old, and you can hear some of your neighbors at times. Overall, my room was rather quiet though. 
I enjoyed my stay overall and would stay again.

Being in the city it was noisy on Saturday night but that was to be expected. The room was very comfortable, except the pillows but that was a problem everywhere we stayed - much too soft. The rooms were clean and serviced daily. The fireplace lent charm and coziness. The old fashioned charm of the hotel was great, including the lift. Breakfast was varied and the 5 pm wine reception amazing. Food was really good and much more than just cheese and biscuits. The opportunity to mix with fellow guests made our stay very interesting. The provision of endless tea, coffee, water & soft drinks as well as cookies was much appreciated. It was in a convenient location just a short walk to the cable cars. The staff were helpful and I would certainly recommend this hotel.

It's an old building and you will hear the floors creak as people walk around so if you're a light sleeper you'll probably want ear plugs. We slept with the windows open and the city wakes up around 4:30 a.m. We were in room 25 and had a nice view of the adjacent buildings garden. My daughter was in room 24 and their view was a brick wall. I had a view and they had privacy. Her in-laws were on the third level that also looked onto the garden. Breakfast was delicious, eggs, sausages, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, and fresh bread to toast. The 5:00 wine reception offered and red and white wine with some other snack.

My first impressions of the hotel were not great. The location is great, just a short stroll to the Union Square and Chinatown, however, when getting there the area seemed a bit grubby. We had to check in in the White Swan next door and it seemed complicated after 11 hr flight. The following day the area no longer was grubby :) The room is on the smaller side, however, we were lucky have a splendid view over the garden.

Everything works. The bed is small but comfy. The fireplace is a lovely extra. What makes this hotel a real gem to me (and at this point I hesitate to share this with you as I hope the hotel will remain the same forever) is the staff and the homely little touches. You can get coffee, tea, water and soft drinks any time from downstairs drinks/fridge area. The breakfast is plentiful (cereal, fruit, eggs, toast, pastries, sausages, croissants and more - there also is some variation each day). There is a pot of (very yummy) cookies for anytime munchies and wine (!!) and some appetizers in the afternoon. The staff are more than happy to help with any questions you might have. There even are some games and a small library.

When checking out I felt like this will be the place I would love to stay again and would definitely recommend this to you, too.

The building across the way is about 30 meters. So I could practically sit in the resident's apartment and watch his TV. Beware, Wednesday morning at 5AM is garbage day. If your windows are open, because it's so damn hot in the room you will start your San Francisco travel day very, very early.
There was no one at the desk on the nights 3/20, 3/21. This I felt was unsafe. If we had questions, we were to go next door to the nicer (Cove) Hotel. The breakfast was ok. I am not trying to be an elitist, but I have been to those little type Parisian hotels, where there are beautiful antiques in each room, croissants, homemade jam and cappuccino for breakfast. This is NOT THAT HOTEL! As Tony Soprano would say,"for get abou dit."

Close to Union square, Nob Hill and Chinatown. A good value if you are not looking for a high end cookie cutter hotel experience.

Our fifth floor room (#54) was very nice but unfortunately the hotel has no air conditioning. I realize that San Francisco weather is cooler than most places but being from around here, I also know that the financial district often has sunny weather and a climate controlled room is a must. We had to leave our windows wide open at night so the room wouldn't be uncomfortably stuffy and the outside noise on Friday night was unbearable. Four miserable hours of sleep was all we could get as drunken revelers were at it long after 2am just outside the hotel. This can't be an isolated occurence in this area, so close to the tenderloin. If we would have had A/C, we would not have had to open the windows and the A/C white noise would have minimized the outside noise. This is the one thing that holds me back from recommending the hotel to others and I myself will pay more for a different hotel next time unless A/C is made available in this hotel (how much can a window unit cost?). If it had A/C, I honestly can say that I would have rated cute little hotel 5 stars.

All of this at one-third of the cost that other hotels of comparable quality were charging for the same weekend. What a find!

The only negative of our stay was that the elevator was broken and we had to use the street access and stairway to get to our room, as did everyone else. Since our room was stationed right by the stairwell door, we were subjected to a very late night and early morning of hearing the door open and slam shut as patrons entered and exited.

All in all, though, it was a great find, and we would stay here again.

Great deal and good location in San Francisco for $100. We had a choice of two queen beds or one king bed at that price. We chose the former and received a spacious, spotless room with a loveseat, table with chairs and floor-to-ceiling bay with window. Other amenities included marble tub surround (ceiling height), large marble vanity, updated bath fixtures, 42" flat-screen TV, refrigerator, coffee maker, hair dryer, iron and ironing board.

The building and rooms are older and the staff is small; but everything is very clean and Tony could not have been more accommodating. There is no restaurant or spa; but free underground parking is included. The security system is very good. The location is covenient (just a few blocks west of Van Ness) to Ghiardelli Square, Fisherman's Wharf and the Marina area.

Only couple of minor gripes: Lombard Street is also U S highway 101; so truck traffic--and, therefore, traffic noise-- is noticeable. Also, there were no doors on the closet; but that was a small, purely aesthetic issue.

The. Coventry Motor Inn is great value. We're anxious to return.

The exterior or the hotel and the lobby were pretty nice - it was just the room that was disappointing. The restaurant/bar was quite nice (if a bit formal) - the atmosphere was good and on the evenings there was a pianist.

Take a car (if you don't mind the valet fee) or public transport to get there - the hill is quite steep!

Overall, the stay was OK - for the price and star rating I just expected much more than I got...

We had a first visit to the Huntington this past weekend; and were fortunate to be upgraded to a suite - room 1001 on the tenth floor. Sweeping views over Fisherman's Wharf to Alcatraz and beyond on one side, and out towards the Bay Bridge on the other. Room was so enjoyable, we wanted to hang out in it, and a great place to recover after a day of site seeing.
A quick few blocks downhill to Union Square (or tough climb up) the location worked for us. The California line for the cable cars goes right by the front door, the Fairmont and its Tonga Room just across the square, and the Cathedral and park right in front of us. Chinatown just a short walk away, and North Beach a little further.
Only spent a brief time in the spa - no services, but jumped in the pool and jacuzzi; very relaxing. The staff and service seemed great; we were very well taken care of.
Perhaps not the place for everyone, but our experience was excellent.
Thank you Huntington!

For $400 a night I was expecting more than what we got. The bed was terrible. We found it hard to sleep as we both got sore backs from the bed. There is no coffee machine in the room and I need my coffee to get going in the morning. The nearest place to get coffee was a 20 minute round trip. There are no ice machines. Instead there is "ice service" @ $3 & tip ! There is no mini bar... just an old fridge in the room which was not working. Yet on the web site it still says that every room has a mini bar, When I asked I was told "oh we no longer do mini bar service". The food in the restaurant was expensive and of poor quality. The staff were very unfriendly and rather snobbish. Ironic considering we were paying guest and they were working there. Never again!

Finally was able to take advantage of a deal offered at a Nob Hill Hotel! The Huntington was a former residential apartment hotel when originally opened, When it changed to a regular hotel they did not subdivide the rooms. Because of this, the rooms are much larger than typical SF hotel rooms. Our 8th floor room had a sitting area complete with sofa, coffee table and large writing desk. Some of the furniture was a little worn but it still allowed you to imagine what it might have been like living in a 1st class residential hotel in the 1920's atop of Nob Hill. The room faced Taylor St. and had a partial view of Grace Cathedral. (As we were leaving, the maid had a door open to a room that faced California St. As I peeked in, I realized the room was smaller but the view was fantastic). One problem that I had with our larger room was the TV was on the far wall. It made it perfect if you were sitting in the living room area but was a little too far to enjoy from the bed.

Our package included breakfast. The 1st morning we did venture down to the Big 4 Restaurant. The service was fantastic. Our waiter, gave us many tourist tips. The regular coffee was great. (The restaurant opens at 0700 but the lobby has the same great coffee available before that time. The last morning I decided to get up early. It was nice to be able to get a coffee to go while I took an early morning walk thru the lovely area. I do this every time I go to SF usually stopping at a Starbucks-there are no SBs on the hill, so this is a nice touch to have good coffee available. The rest of the mornings we used our breakfast voucher and splurged on room service-relaxing relaxing relaxing-to start our day that way, All of the entrees we ordered were delicious. Again service impeccable.

Also loved that there is a doorman and only one way into lobby. Not several entrances where people are coming and going. Concierge available and helpful.

Initially was told free Wifi only available in lobby. I brought my tablet down there as I wanted to look something up but couldn't get on. Concierge came over and helped me figure it out. Apparently the Wifi was available and free in the room as I was not charged when I later when I used it in my room.

I had a massage in the spa- a little pricey at $130 for 50 minutes but the spa area is very nice. I loved it because no children under 16 years old are not allowed the in pool or jacuzzi. (for those with children: Handerly, Palace, Sheraton at the wharf, Marriott on Market all allow children at their pools), This made the Spa experience very relaxing. Use of pool, jacuzzi and sun deck free with hotel stay.

The California Cable Car stops right in front of hotel. You can buy an all day pass for the Cable Cars and buses for $14 directly from the Cable Car attendant. You cannot buy these from the busdrivers. Each Cable Car ride is $6 and bus is $2. So if you plan to travel throughout the city, this may be a good option to invest in. No bus lines to my knowledge run in front of the hotel so you have to use the Cable Car (which is fun anyway) or walked to another street to access the busline. (The hotel also says they have a limo that goes to Union Square) The other thing about the California Cable car is that it is not as crowded as the other 2 lines and so I find it more enjoyable to ride. We rode the other line in the evening down to the Wharf area. It was so crowded that you really couldn't see anything if you were inside.

While I love the hustle and bustle of Union Square, it is nice to be in an area that is peaceful. Across the street is Grace Cathedral-looking somewhat like Notre Dame. It has a replica of the Ghilberti Doors. Across the street is Huntington Park. It has a replica of the Tortoise Fountain from Rome.

So to wrap it up, Great Service, great hotel and spa, and great area.

We just love the Huntington and look forward to staying there whenever in SF. It is a small but elegant old hotel with a great spa/pool area that is so inviting we use it often to just destress. It overlooks the City from the top of Nob hill with a geat view from the pool and out door terrace. Unfortunately it needs some restoration since the pool overflows when one does laps so they have banned laps which is a MAJOR pity. Hopefully under their new management they can rmedy the situation. Also, it is so annoying to have to pay extra for the wi-fi. But the restaurant, the piano cocktail area and the ambiance more than make up for the inconveniences. Unfortrunately the rooms the sound carries very easily between rooms.

(great linens & pillows) Older hotel with European charm; renovated room with modern amenities. The location can not be beat; across from Huntington Park and Grace Cathedral. We walked in every direction to sight seeing and restaurants.

The bellman and cleaning staff were among some of the most considerate and professional I've encountered. Front desk staff was 50/50; some fantastic but others a little haughy at times; one early morning my husband went to the lobby and asked for a business document to be faxed and the front desk man asked him "if he was even staying here"....needless to say that frosted my husband a bit.

The spa is the added bliss moment of our stay. Guests have free access to the spa facilities which are fantastic. Great steam rooms, saunas, small but refreshing pool, jacuzzi and deck with loung chairs. I hear the spa services are great as well....maybe next time!

This is at the top end of a 3 star rated hotel - it could easily be a higher rating if the old boys club (the Elks) that take up the lower floors shared their toys (spa, handball court etc.)

As a solo woman traveler, the location couldn't be better. A stone throw from Union Square and 4 short blocks to the Powell Station (BART & Muni.) I felt safe on all the main streets in the area & knew not to venture to some of the less safe areas.

The room itself was comfortably cozy, very clean, had a large closet to store my luggage, hang my clothes etc. The bathroom was a reasonable size, and had a huge mirror that covered most of the wall. A glass shelf was large enough to hold all my toiletries. The shower had great water pressure. The bed was very comfy. Free wi-fi in the rooms and access to the business office on the 5th floor to print boarding pass or use computer to check e-mail etc.

I requested and received a quiet room, though it faced the side of the building next door, so had no view, it was indeed very quiet and also stayed cool - a compromise well worth it to me.

The staff are all exceptionally friendly and helpful, which certainly adds to the pleasant experience. Vincent and his co-workers always seemed happy to answer my many questions & show me where things were on the map.

Taking the BART from the airport was fairly simple $8.10 each way - I loaded $16.20 on a card when I arrived so that I wouldn't have to worry about it when I departed. Take the train to the Powell Station about a 1/2 hr ride. When you exit take the escalator up, you will need to insert your BART card to open the turnstile then go to your right to the Halidie Plaza, take a sharp right and go up the escalator to Market Street, then walk straight up Powell 4 blocks to Post Street and turn left. It is a bit of an up hill hike.

The Muni (subway & trains) cost $2 per trip except the cable cars which are $6 per trip. There is a terrific cafe 2 doors down from the KP called La Taza, is open by 7am & closes at 8pm. The chocolate scone is sinfully delicious. Had the vegetarian quesadella one lunch and it was the best I have ever tasted. Prices are very good & they do have a menu on their web site.

The highlights of my 3 days were the Alcatraz Audio Tour, Dinner & Walking Tour of Chinatown and going to a Giants game at AT & T Park.

This Hotel definitely has the charm & personality that I much prefer over the cookie cutter brand name hotels. The hospitality is warm & genuine, not forced and pretentious.

My husband and I showed up for out first overnight with out our three little kids in five year. We were tired and in need of a break. Immediately when we arrived at the hotel we noticed that we had walked into an alternate universe. Service with a more than just a smile, we suddenly transformed from tired parents into a world where everyone we met wanted to help and serve us and make sure our stay was amazing. It was so hard to go home. We have never been treated like royalty before and it was SOOOO amazing to be rock stars for a night. The rooms were also amazing, clean and the bed was very comfortable. I give this hotel a 5 plus start rating! Go, you will not be disappointed!!!!

Service is professional, not overly engaged or friendly, but we had no issues with anyone. The flair of the hotel is quite continental, a bit strange in decoration, but for a hotel of this age approriate and one can find it charming, too.
Only two things to be aware of - hotel windows are single pane, thus a bit noisy in the morning (at least for rooms towards the front with the street) and of course parking a car in the center of SF, well costs a fortune (minimum $25 a night), as parking spots at the curbside are extremely rare to find....

We have been staying at the Kensington Park hotel for several years. It is always welcoming, squeaky clean and you can't beat the location. I have read many reviews here about the hotel and there are 2 common complaints- the rooms are small and no A/C. Well, the rooms are not huge, but they are comfortable and if you are there on vacation, why spend a lot of time in your room? There is so much to do in S.F.! The A/C issue has never bothered us as we open the window- there is always a breeze and it cools off in the evening. It has never affected my sleep.

One terrific aspect of this hotel is Mr. Robert Finney, the concierge. He has always been there, knows San Francisco very well and is a really interesting man if you take some time to talk with him.

The staff were very polite and the concierge helped us a great deal with his knowlege of the city and the best way to get around.

Overall, this hotel is o.k. for a few nights stay but very pricey for what amenities you get!

On the plus side, if you get one of the "hop on, hop off" tour buses, the stop is just outside the hotel and the trolley car stop is just around the corner on Powell Street.

I recently spent two nights at the Travelodge Presidio and found it to be an efficient, quiet and adequate hotel. Check in procedure was speedy and the front desk supplied us with useful information about the surroundings and about public transport in the area. The room was not large but not cramped either and it was supplied with airco, satellite tv, coffee maker, a desk and chair. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was small , but well organized and water pressure in the shower was very good. The ventilation was instead a bit slow, so often the air would be a bit stuffy.
Both room and bathroom were very clean.
The breakfast was included in the room rate and served in a room adjacent to the hotel office. It included tea and coffee, juice, muffins, milk and cereal. It wasn't the best ever but it was ok. My only complaint is that coffee was really not that good.
The Travelodge is positioned a bit outside the main tourist area, but still close enough for us to walk to fisherman's wharf (about 20-25 min walk) and other touristy spots. The area is also served by a few buses which pass frequently enough.
I did enjoy my visit at the Travelodge and I would not hesitate to recommend it to others.

Very quiet, the staff is absolutely awesome, great price, awesome updated rooms, FREE PARKING. We had to park around back and they had survallence all over. It was great to feel so secure. The staff was so friendly and very knowledgable. They told us how to get to certain bus stops, best places to eat, best places to visit, and even printed out a list of tours for us!. The only problem for me personally was that it wasn't as close to the Wharf and Pier as I had hoped, which isn't that big of a deal. I will DEFINITELY stay here again. It's like staying in a 3 or 4 star hotel for a lot cheaper. Thank you guys for making our vacation so great!!

We traveled to SF with another couple and were looking for a place near all of the attractions, yet affordable. My wife found both in the Travelodge on Lombard. The room was better than expected (for the price) and the location was great. The most surprising part of our trip was Raymond Archer, the concierge. One of the most friendly and outgoing people I've met who was honest about what attractions were worth our time and which ones were not. Raymond took the time to map out 2-3 bus routes as well as the trolley route, highlighting great restaurants/stops along each route.After asking us about what types of foods we liked or wanted to try, he suggested a multitude of restaurants, guaranteeing we wouldn't be disappointed; the food was incredible! Raymond overflowed with excitement about "his" city and all it had to offer. His services and knowledge were better than any concierge I've encountered in the states or abroad. Travelodge has a huge resource and "plus" in Raymond Archer. Thank you Raymond for making our trip so much more efficient and affordable with your advice! 5 STAR SERVICE!!!!!

We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Travelodge. I booked this trip after reading previous reviews here on Tripadvisor, and I have to say, I was very pleased with the selection.

Located in a very quiet section of San Francisco, just steps away from the entrance to the Presidio, this hidden gem is the deal of the city. Raymond, Niki, and Bruce are wonderful hosts, and truly work hard to make you feel at home. There was no question too bothersome (believe me, I asked my fair share). Everyone was quick to help with directions, restaurant recommendations, and ideas for fun places to spend the day.

We returned to the hotel in the early evening each day, and made use of the offering of coffee, tea and cookies. These were greatly enjoyed and appreciated after a full day of touring. The breakfast is not extensive, but is just perfect to start the day. There are so many wonderful restaurants to try in SF, that all we needed was a croissant, cereal, muffin or coffee to get us going. We caught a local bus just a block or so down the street to all locations for touring. This worked out perfectly for us.

We found this hotel to be a great value. It was less than half the price of other hotels we looked at in Union Square. I have to say we treasured returning to a quiet location at the end of the day. Book this hotel. You won't be sorry.

We came straight from the airport and were too early for check in but were allowed to park our car and begin touring SF. Bruce was on duty when we arrived. He gave us great neighborhood restaurant recommendations (all good) and drew Muni bus lines on our map. Niki and Raymond were also wonderful; made us feel welcome and answered our many questions. The room is small but comfortable and clean. We've stayed at other Travelodges but this is the first one with such a wonderful staff. Would definitely stay again and recommend it to anyone travelling to SF. We never drove our car until we checked out; walked to neighborhood restaurants and reasonable walk to bus stops. Can't say enough about the helpfulness of the staff.

'High Class Boutique Hotel'

XV Beacon Hotel (Fifteen Beacon) is a luxurious boutique hotel on the top of Beacon Hill in Boston. Walking distance to shops, parks and restaurants (everything is walking distance in Boston), this hotel is situated 15 minutes from Boston Logan BOS Airport (approx. $22 taxi fare).
The hotel is a 1903 landmark building with the charm of historic Boston but with the comfort of chic, classic and modern facilities. With only 63 rooms in the entire hotel, XV Beacon hotel feels like a home away from home, with friendly and helpful staff at the front desk and concierge. Each room has a cozy feeling including your own gas fireplace. We have stayed at this hotel twice in the last five years and even during our recent visit the service and quality remains superior.
During our May visit we stayed in room 404 (which happened to be the largest suite on that floor) - each floor only has seven guest rooms. Opt for one of the Beacon Hill Studio's you won't regret it - including either a Queen or King Bed, gas fireplace, large flat screen TV, large sitting area, and fabulous bathroom.
One other great feature at XV Beacon is their complimentary in-town Lexus car service. The hotel has one Sedan and one SUV that can accommodate either 2 or 4 passengers. Service is available on a first come-first serve basis; however if you know you are headed somewhere specific during your stay you can pencil in your time and location with the concierge. This is a fantastic service since taxi's are not that easy to find in Boston, and not as affordable as they are in NYC. Be sure to take advantage of this service during your stay.

Housekeeping turndown was a disappointment. The bed was fixed but wastebaskets and bath towels were not refreshed in the living room bath.
The restaurant was enjoyable for breakfast and I almost had the place to myself.
For dinner on Saturday, MOOOO was busy. The food was good. It was a bit pricey , $44 for swordfish with no extras. The best deal is to puchase the extra sampling at $18 for two people which included some tasty sides.

This will be an unusual review since I've never actually stayed in this hotel. However, I believe I have something to say that will recommend this hotel as a great place to stay. First of all, it is beautiful, elegant and has a terrific location. But, that's not my story. My story has to do with an employee that went above and beyond the call of duty to a person who was not even a guest at the hotel. Here it is:

My husband and I were on a cruise ship stopping in Boston for a partial day port stop. It poured rain during our entire visit to Boston. We stopped on the sidewalk under the overhanging roof of the XV Hotel. We needed a moment's respite from the rain and also, I wanted to take a picture without getting my camera drenched. We spoke to the two uniformed doormen about this need and they were very friendly and said, yes, by all means, stand under the porch. With a laugh, I remarked that this was our one day in Boston and this (the rain) was our unfortunate introduction to the remarkable city. One of the doorman (whom I will call Mr. M in this account) very kindly said, 'Wait just a moment,' and went inside the hotel. He quickly came out with an umbrella which he presented to me (I'd not brought mine, hoping the rain would stop  it never did!).

I was overwhelmed with his kindness and immediately thought, this must be the best hotel in the city and what a friendly town  and certainly, this was the most generous and kind doorman I'd ever met. The umbrella, by the way, was a tremendous help to me as the rain started pouring more and more. I will never forget this kindness and I will always have good feelings for the town, the hotel and that thoughtful doorman. Thank you, Mr. M -- you know who you are.

The website for XV Beacon Hill tells how the attractive building is a 1903 landmark Beaux Arts hotel, located on the crest of Beacon Hill. I can attest to the fact that the location is excellent for sightseeing. It is a luxury boutique hotel and, I'm afraid, on the pricey side (at least for my pocketbook). While I would love to stay there, I don't foresee that happening. Regardless, I would recommend this hotel to those of you who can afford a wonderful, luxury hotel with kind doormen and a very short walk to the State Capitol and the lovely green Boston Common park.

Kudos to XV Beacon Hill Hotel and the very kind Mr. M!

(There are controls for both next to the bed.) The marble bathroom with rain shower head was also very nice.

We were very pleased with our stay at XV Beacon and highly recommend it.

From arrival to departure, this was a WOW experience and we have been all around the world and have experienced it all.
Our stay last month at XV Beacon was absolutely wonderful from start to finish. (The cab driver at the airport said: Good choice of hotels!) We have recommended this boutique hotel to several couples who live in the area and visited us. They agreed that XV Beacon is the perfect place for their other friends, too.

Location: 10++ (20 of 10) - walking distance to everything and everyplace; rooftop patio is fantastic; nice exercise/spa area; close to many excellent restaurants, including Moo, where we dined for dinner and brunch, and met friends for cocktails several times  all were impressed
Staff: 10++ (20 of 10)  friendly, professional ,excited to be at XV Beacon; helpful
Concierges: 10++ (20 of 10)  friendly, professional, knowledgeable, interested in finding the perfect places for us and things to do and everyone was SO NICE and made us so comfortable
Decoration; artwork, furniture, fireplace, etc.: 10++ - The rain shower head is relazing and incredible, and the water pressure is so nice. The bed helped us slept like babies each night; the fireplace was comforting and warm; the entire room and hotel was decorated to perfection. In-house Lexus and driver: 10++ (20 of 10)  impressive; excellent and caring drivers; comfortable cars. Very nice perk for guests.
Housekeeping: 10++ (20 of 10)  SPOTLESS; considerate; professional; friendly, etc. LOVE the ability for us to indicate whether we needed or wanted housekeeping service. Very considerate feature that we appreciated.
Room comfort: 10++ Ultra QUIET ROOM on the back corner. The shower head is PERFECT.
Water pressure is AMAZING. Nice bathrobes, towels and linens. Also liked the vases in the rooms - which we filled with tulips from the local market.
We definitely will return.
MAJOR COMPLIMENTS: we arrived at about 6 am and were immediately welcomed cheerfully and then checked in and given a most-excellent room. That is amazing (most hotels sigh and tell their guests that check in is 3 pm). The staff is THE BEST, in a beautiful location and facility, and they all are so happy to be there.
Many thanks for making our vacation incredibly wonderful.

We went to New York last month and couldn't resist a train ride to Boston for Easter and a return visit. We had our favourite corner room, ate in the restaurants - Teatro and Sorrelina - owned by the same people who own the hotel and where we always return, and met up again with the wonderful Michael, Head Concierge and all his colleagues. This is a hotel where the staff really do care. They even tracked down a Newcastle football match that wasn't on the television back in England - how's that for attention to detail?! We "love them to bits". You will too.

The ever present availability of a free chauffeur driven car service is the icing on the cake. The rooms are very well appointed and the bedding in particular is great. If there is a downside to the hotel it is that few, if any, of the rooms have views of the nearby Boston Commons and Public Gardens, but that's pretty much par for the course in this area of town. If you want the views you'll have to stay at the Four Seasons which literally fronts the Commons and the Gardens.

But the room had not been thoroughly cleaned. There was a decent layer of dust by the fridge, mini bar, and bureau. If it hadn't been for proximity for a special event I would not have chosen Le Meridien on Battery. The one plus to the location is being steps away from the pier and farmer's market. On Sunday's many things were closed and you had to plan ahead before you came in for the night if wanted something else besides room service and the mini bar. The bone I have to pick with Le Meridien is that you have to pay for WiFi service. They charge nearly $13 a day. In a city known for it's tech sector I think it is absolutely outrageous that we would have to pay for WiFi. All of these things put together, I don't strongly recommend Le Meridien.

I recently stayed over Memorial weekend with my girlfriend for a romantic getaway and Le Meridien had everything we needed for our trip. The moment we drove our car into the Valet section we were greeted and helped with a smile. We arrived early to the hotel, around 11:30am and at first the receptionist told me there were no rooms available yet, but as my girlfriend went to the restroom the receptionist checked again and they had a room ready for me, which I thought was accomodating since the policy is not to check in until 3pm. The rooms were perfect size and although we were in a lower floor, never had noise disturbance. The rooms have everything a 4 star hotel has and the bed were so comfortable that we decided to stay the first night in around 7pm after sightseeing for a little bit and slept in until the next day. Did not get to eat at the hotel, since there are so many amazing options in San Francisco. Union Square is only a 15 minute walk or a $7 taxi ride and I truly recommend to walk up to Embarcadero and have breakfast or lunch there. If you get to stay at Le Meridien on a Saturday morning please do not miss The Farmers Market at Embarcadero and have the hand dripp Blue Bottle Coffee and a Prochetta Sandwhich from Roti Rori and start your day from there, you will not regret it. Also Chinatown is about 3 blocks away and Fishermans Wharf is only a trolley away from Embarcadero. And please if you have any questions or suggestions do not hesitate to ask the concierge, she was amazing!!!

The valet was quick. Our car was always ready and waiting for us within 5-10 mins. of calling down for it.

We did not eat at or sit in the bar area but it always seemed like it was busy and fun.

This hotel is in the financial area. It seems like a lot of the businesses close early in this area, but it is close to other areas that do have businesses that stay open later. If you are considering this hotel, I wouldn't let that change your decision. This hotel really is in a good location.

Overall, I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. It exceded our needs and we would definitely recommend Le Meridien to family and friends.

We ordered room service for dessert (chocolate chip cheesecake) which came up as regular cheesecake, which did not appeal to us. As they were apparently out of the requested item, the hotel was happy to replace it with something else or remove the charge, which I thought was good customer service. Hotel parking fee was $60+, so we changed our car rental to avoid paying that fee. Laura, at the concierge desk, was very helpful in recommending restaurants and mapping out transportation options to make it to our rental car facility in South San Francisco. We were happy with our stay there.

'Great Views and good location'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 29, 2012

The lobby and entrace are underwhelming, but everything is very nice. The front desk was very friendly. There is a great work-out room. The rooms are smaller than I expected, but well appointed. We were lucky enough to get a high floor with a bay view, which is really worth asking for. The beds were a little soft from use.

We recently had a nice stay at Le Meridien, checking in on a busy Friday afternoon. It's a surprisingly small lobby for such a sky scraper of a hotel, but the reception was friendly and efficient. As some other reviewers have stated, being located in the Financial District makes for a fairly quiet neighborhood feeling in the evening and on the weekend. Nevertheless, I think for folks who enjoy walking, it's an ideal spot to hoof it over to the Embarcadero (the Ferry Building & Fisherman's Wharf), or wander up Market Street to Powell Street and Union Square. As I am a light sleeper, we requested a room in the upper floors, and we were very pleased, indeed, with our room which faced north (with views to the west and east as well). We could see the "Pyramid" building, spirals of churches in North Beach, Marin, and part of the Bay Bridge. The room itself was nicely furnished and the bed was very comfortable. The only critique we have is that no coffee maker was available in the room. Fortunately, there is a complimentary coffee and tea service (self-serve) in the lobby.

We made late reservations to attend a Giants game on Bay to Breakers weekend and although this room was overpriced it was a nice hotel. I am an SPG member so I commonly stay at Westin's or W's but since they were both booked we thought we would try Le Meridian. Although I prefer Union Square this location was not bad. Our room was $400 a night which was overpriced but understandable because of the weekend. Staff was friendly and the downstairs bar enjoyable for a few cocktails. Upon check-in they asked if we would like a corner balcony which is a hard find in San Fransisco, and we gladly took it. Bathroom was huge and room a decent size. Decor nice and everything was clean and in good shape. We walked to AT&T park along Embarcadero which wasn't far. The price was high but I often see the room rates for this hotel and sometimes you can get a decent deal when everywhere else is pricey.

Had a parkview room on the 10th floor, which was well appointed. As others have mentioned, Top of the Mark is PRICEY!! But the views are awesome, so its worth just taking a peek. An amazing surprise was the wine and card left in our room for our 10 year anniversary. That was unexpected and much appreciated. Connie at the front desk was wonderful. We found it really annoying that it costs $16 for 24 hours of WIFI. That should be included ... very nickle and dimed with that. They are also somewhat cheap with the coffee/creamer and sugar. We had to call twice in three days b/c they only gave one packet each time we asked. (each little pack contains a couple of creamers, 2 sugars and 2 sweet n lows). Also, I have to stress, the hills are BRUTAL!!! The location is super convenient, and walking downhill is fine, but uphill ... holy moley! Unbelievable torture is the only way to describe it. We were ill prepared for the strain on our calf muscles. So definitely do research and figure out your transportation, because its really tough walking up and down the hills. But aside from that, Nob Hill is a great area, and the architecture is amazing. Overall, the Intercontinental was a great hotel, with great staff and a few irritations that we easily overlooked. We would stay here again for sure!

No crowds at all. We held meetings on the Mezzanine level, along a with a meal or two - the service was very attentive. Location is great -- you can visit the Fairmont lobby for afternoon piano music and visit the Tonga Room for dinner, as we did as a group. Internet service worked easily (fee).All in all, they held their own with any of the other big hotels in town. I was very pleased overall. Beware the valet parking fee...standard at these hotels.

When I entered my room, Golden Gate was not even in my range. It was totally on the other side. No one took the responsibility for ruining my day. I traveled all the way to enjoy the fireworks that happens every 25 years but it got messed up. I will never recommend anyone to go in there. If they cannot even keep their promises then what is the reason for selecting such a brand name hotel. It sucks.

We only stayed here for one night pre-cruise and this is an opinion based on the few hours we were in the hotel. It is certainly an imposing building in a wonderful location. We were cruising with Regent Seven Seas and their staff were at the hotel to look after us (figuratively speaking). The reception staff were very helpful on check-in and later in providing a map and advice about getting to Union Square. The room was of medium size without any decent views from the window. Our view consisted of rooftops and backs of other buildings! The beds were super comfortable and the bathroom very well appointed. The room itself was the usual bland international hotel style that we have experienced all over the world. However we were jet lagged and only there for one night and the room provided all we needed for our short stay.

The Top of the Mark dining room/bar has fantastic views over San Francisco. The food was good, so was the service. Less good was the 'gatekeeper'. Other reviewers have noted the long wait for a table. Our request for a table for two was met with a 'we don't have any, you will have to wait'. How long? 'Probably 20 minutes, maybe half an hour'. Two other people offered to share a table and suddenly the ice melted. Quite a crowd built up in the lobby while we were having our meal.

Breakfast was in the Top of the Mark. Usual buffet selection - no egg station but the food was good and well presented.

Although our stay at Mark Hopkins was very short we did enjoy the experience.

The view from out hotel was worth the price, and room was well appointed. Service was good at the hotel, the staff were helpful and knowledgeable about the city. The cleaning staff were great, I saw first hand that they bring each room clean glasses and coffee mugs, they don't just wash them in the sink like most hotels. Our cleaning staff always refilled our coffee station. What was disappointing about the hotel was the lack of free Wi-Fi. I can't remember the last time I stayed at a hotel that did not have free Wi-Fi. Also, booking over their website did not work and I ended up having to call the 1-800 number to make my reservation. Overall, the price is worth it if you are looking for a hotel with a great view in a prime location.

This was our second stay (last time was August, 2010) and it hasn't changed. Our room was clean, had a safe, and the bathroom was spotlessly clean and had a great shower with lots of hot water and a sink outside of the bathroom to ease our morning preparations. The flat screen TV was nice but we only watched it for the weather as we were out and about in our very short stay in SF (off to Northern California). The hotel is very close to North Beach, Chinatown, and Fisherman's Wharf. While this would not be considered a luxury hotel by anyone's standards it fits my 5 star requirements (and I have stayed in many so-called luxury hotels that didn't meet my standards): clean with furnishings in good shape, all of the amenities, quiet room with a comfortable bed, near excellent places to eat, a friendly and helpful front desk staff, and free parking (almost unheard of in San Francisco where you can pay up to $40 a night for the "privilege'). There is no fancy lobby but I think in all of our travels (and we tend to do a major trip for pleasure at least 4 times a year) I have sat in the lobby 3 times. I believe the key to getting a quiet room here is to reserve well in advance and state your preferences. I asked for a room on the same side as "Bimbo's" as we were there during an evening when a performance was occurring and there was really no disturbance whatsoever (my husband is a very light sleeper and he slept like a log) (there is a cute view of the apartment building next door and the "pocket garden" which is very tranquil). The view from the room was incredible--Coit Tower, San Francisco skyline (including TransAmerica building) and there was NO street noise. I could be wrong, but our room was either 305 or 307. For breakfast you can walk up Columbus to La Boulange or one of the authentic Italian cafes (we go to La Boulange because my husband LOVES their granola with yogurt). We ate lunch (on our way in from SFO) at the Beach Chalet which is at the entrance to Golden Gate Park and across from the beach (down the street from the Cliff House) and had a wonderful meal theremy husband a salad with Ahi Tuna and myself a Crab Louis salad with the sweetest Dungeness crab meat and a super champagne or chardonnay vinaigrette dressing. This time around we ate dinner at Sotto Mare on Green Street just up the street from the hotel and highly recommend it if you love good seafood in an unpretentious atmosphere with fairly reasonable prices. My husband had sand dabs (a sweeter flounder) and I had prawns--yum, yum.

In conclusion I would DEFINITELY stay here again and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for the things that make a great stay for me. We really enjoyed our stay and hope you will too!

Little Italy was a few blocks up.

Concern about the night vlub next door quickly evaporated the first night when all was quiet. Rooms are large and have the normal fittings expected in hotel. TV must have been about 40" Real perk was the free parking which we needed until we returned our rental, this has to save at least $40 per night from what I could see from other holets. Three or four block easy walk to Fisherman's wharf one way and a similar distance up Columbus to find some great Italian restaurants.
Would certainly recommend.

On our most recent trip to SF, we wanted to stay in North Beach like we always do. But we didn't want to spend a lot of money. And, because this was the start of a road trip, we had to contend with having a rental car. Enter the Columbus Motor Inn.

Their parking lots (I think there were two) are located under the inn. It's a tight fit, but what a great deal to have free parking in the city. If the lot off Columbus is full, take your first right along the side of the inn - there's another small lot down that alley.

The rooms aren't anything special. We didn't have the balcony that so many other reviews mention - if I were to stay at the inn again, I'd probably try to figure out how to get one of those rooms (we stayed in a King, so maybe that's the difference). Didn't have an issue with noise at night, even though we were right on Columbus. All the wine at dinner might have helped.

Great location, easy parking, cheap cheap cheap.

We stayed here for 4 nights in May 2012. The hotel is in a great location within walking distance to many attractions in San Francisco. My wife and I like to walk so for us China town and the wharf were within easy walking distance. Our room was on the second floor with a balcony that overlooked Columbus Street. We did notice some street noise but it was not loud enough to prevent a good night's sleep. The rooms are clean and the staff is very helpful with directions and recommendations. We had a rental car so the free parking was great. Some of our more enjoyable activities while in San Francisco are listed below.

1. Muir Woods
2. Golden Gate Park
3. Crossing the Golden Gate Bridge on bikes. You can take a ferry back to the Warf. Check for discount coupons for rentals.
4. The Cable Car Museum.
5. Walking and riding the Warf area.
6. Breakfast at the Hollywood Caf near the wharf.
7. Dinner at the Fog Harbor Fish House at pier 39 on the wharf.

Note though that this is a BIG hotel and if you are looking for something more on the boutique scale this isn't it - Also this is more in the Tenderloin district than Union Square but no big deal and easily walk-able to just about any place you want

Also - ate at Jaspers just across the street at O'Farrel and Taylor and it's a good alternative to the in-house gastropub with decent pricing and a good selection of food and beers!

Health club was much better than the average hotel. Didn't eat there (Hotel food is usually bland and expensive). Only complaint was the occasional noise from the hall - walls seemed to be thinner than normal. I'd definitely stay there again.

'Four stars with some tarnish'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 31, 2012

Recently, I spent 4 nights at this hotel. It is a 4 stars hotel, conveniently located in downtown San Francisco. Generally, I was satisfied. However, there are certain things that can be improved. The hotel advertises free wireless high-speed internet which is deceptive, since they do not tell you that it is free only in the lobby. In the room they charge $12.90 per day, which I consider quite steep. Other hotels in the vicinity offer free room internet. I would have not booked this hotel had I known that room internet service is for pay. It was even more irritating, since two weeks before coming I inquired in an e-mail to the hotel about the cost of internet. To this day the hotel did not bother to respond. Internet in the lobby was working fine though the environment was quite noisy. The problem was to find a clean table. Starbucks coffee shop had a couple of tables for their customers, however, people were leaving empty cups, napkins and trash across the lobby. Particularly in the morning hotel needs to clean the tables of trash., coffee stains and crumbs more frequently. Yet one more comment. Every morning the guests find in front of the door USA Today newspaper which is nice until you read the Welcome folder given to you with you room key which on page 3 states that you are charged $0.75 for this service. The room rates are not cheap. Do they really have to charge for internet and newspapers?

Wish we would have known about the newly remodeled rooms because the decor and furniture was not up to par when I think of Hilton. Recommend parking in one of the multiple public garages nearby to save $30+ a day in hotel parking fees, however; you are downtown and will have to deal with bums harassing you for money.

Overall pleasant stay. They should consider offering free wifi in rooms and not just the lobby. Would stay here again.

Hotel is going thru a renovation but you would not know it as they have isolated the section under renovation. The hotel has an activities desk and we bought tickets for a Double Decker bus tour , the closest pickup was nearby at Union Square and we had a great tour. Lot's of deli/convenient stores in walking distance and tons of places to dine. A good hotel to base yourself from ( they also have rental car agencies across the street )..

Sharing reviews is what I do, some people don't like them as I speak the truth, especially as I speak from the heart. It has taken me a few days to get the exact wording for this review. I wanted to be able to capture all of the products I used , remember all the people involving my trip and the whole overall experience. I can't go into full detail why things were extra special, but I can say, they just were over the top. Starting with Monika, who was just married( and I pray has a long and blessed life), to wonderful. Ray, who took over care of my family and made my stay the most memorable one for me and my niece who will never forget this hotel or visit to NYC . That was my goal. This hotel is located literally steps away from Times Square, the NYPD, and all of the delights of NYC. We did a full circle that lead us back to our hotel. The suite was amazing. The bathroom big enough to move. Being handicapped they placed special bars for me in the bath to make it easier to get up and out, ( who does that). There were plenty of towels, shampoos and robes, never had to call and ask for anything. The beds were so comfortable I actually slept through the night, something I haven't done in years. They also had special pillow types. From the doorman Steven , to Jeff. And all the other staff, but especially RAY... I recommend this hotel with a 10 star rating and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else in NYC.

The room was a good size, nicely decorated and very clean. (It's not a high rise hotel so there is no view from the window to speak of, however).
The staff are exceptional - always smiling and eager to please. The lounge is an absolute haven of peace from the noise of Manhatten. The breakfasts, evening cheese and wine, and the all-day snacks and drinks are excellent. Obviously, you have paid for all of this in the price of the room, but worth every penny. We would have no hesitation in staying here again if we ever come to NYC.

You meet a lot of nice people hanging out in the lobby, and it is a much more personal experience. Several good hotels are within walking distance, and the Times Square is next door. Highly recommend this. The rooms are modest, but comfortable.

The room was a good size for a New York hotel, nicely decorated and very clean. Rick's Cafe provided a peaceful retreat from the madness of Times Square. This was all very good, but the staff was exceptional! They did everything they could to ensure our stay was pleasant - the welcome when we arrived, providing assistance with directions, the best way to travel to our destination, obtaining tickets. We never saw the housekeeping staff, yet our room was always clean. It was like they watched to see when we went out, then came in to clean. To sum it up in a single word, this hotel is EXCEPTIONAL!

We stayed in a standard room which is small but with a spacious bathroom. Rooms are clean but a bit 'dark'. The beds are small both in width as in length.
The ambiance is relaxed and you can reload your batteries here before jumping into the streetlife again. Big thank you again to the staff !

I will start with a statement: this could be far the best hotel in NYC. I can not compare it to many others, I had a chance to stay at Trump Int only, but I was impressed with the extremely warm and efficient attention from the entire team at Setai.

We had a long trip from Europe with a 5 y.o. kid and although I had to wait in line to do check-in (one person was trying to help some guest while another one was typing something on his computer...not a great welcome sign to your guests) and nobody greeted me on arrival except bellboys (huge credits to everyone!) I can not fault our overall experience.

The suit I booked through LHW was huge (but no kitchen as mentioned in some other reviews...). It overlooked Fifth Ave and was very clean, large and well appointed. This is so different compare to Trump Int.! But I was not very happy with a fact that there was no bedding prepared for our son (it was clearly stated in my reservation that we are 2 adults and 1 kid) so he slept with us in one bed (we were too tied to spend time solving it on arrival). No special attention to LHW members, no upgrade (but I do not complain as we are not fancy about such things).

What I liked the most was the honesty and clearness in what is offered: in-room refreshments and internet are free and it is made clear to you when you make reservation and it makes you feel like a real guest. I appreciate the honesty of including such details in the price of the room instead of charging you extra for water or anything else (so annoying sometimes). There is no alcohol in the minibar though...I guess you need to order it? There were no instructions on it anywhere...

Hotel's location is somewhat in the middle of nowhere, but you can easily walk to all major sights. It could be a problem for those coming from small towns or those being in NYC for the first time, but we did not find it difficult to walk anywhere.

Food: Breakfast was absolutely fantastic. In room dining too. I loved the food. BUT, I would expect a bigger choice for vegetarians and those who prefer organic food. They failed to offer us any of the juices I asked for (even water melon...) and I found it strange for a hotel trying to market itself as a 5 star hotel. Could be because hotel does not have its own restaurant but the one being attached to it is servings hotel guests (that is how I understood the concept...). There seem to be some confusion in orders and we had something missing every time we placed an order for in-room dining (we rarely went down to the restaurant for breakfast, etc.). I think restaurant and housekeeping should have some better system on how to cooperate and communicate properly.

No issues with housekeeping.

Overall, this is a very nice property. Great staff. I highly recommend the Setai.

We visit NYC regularly and usually stay at one of the other luxury hotels in the area. After reading some reviews which placed the Setai atop the hotel world in New York, we decided to give it a try.

I'm not sure what the guests who commented so favorably experienced, but it was nothing like our experience. Also, I'm going to review this room as compared to other five-star hotels in NYC. And also given that the rack rate for a Studio Suite is $745 a night... (although AMEX got us a much better deal).

The lobby is very small and unimpressive. Check-in was delayed because the room wasn't ready (at 5:45 p.m.). The front desk personnel graciously offered us free drinks in the lobby bar while we waited. However, we needed to move fast because we had a 7:30 reservation at Daniel.

The room still wasn't ready at 6:40, so my GF had to change in the spa... Certainly not ideal.

When we did get back to the room to check-in, we noticed what looked to be drips of blood going from the carpet near the bed out to the mini-bar. Gross! We called the front desk and, rather than move us to a different room, they sent someone up to disinfect and clean the spots (they referred to them as 'coffee', yea right. I've never seen bright red coffee before).

There was a large tear and hole in the bedsheet. The bed was billed as a 'king' but was not. A queen at best. They initially offered only two pillows, but we had more brought to the room.

The room itself is large, but with a bunch of wasted, empty space. Minimalist doesn't begin to describe it. Emptiness is perhaps a better descriptor?? Bathroom was great. Expansive and lots of marble.

The 'personal assistants' offered by the hotel (branded name for 'concierge') were very nice, but useless. I've read other reviews where they forgot to give a wake-up call or didn't make a dinner reservation, and I couldn't believe it at a hotel of this supposed stature. But sure enough, that's exactly what they did to us, on more than one occasion.

Also, you can rarely get them on the phone. Many times the phone would just ring, with no answer. What is the point of selling a '24-hour personal assistant' when you can't get them on the phone for 23.5 of those hours??

The Bar on Fifth was nice. Great place to relax and have a drink. Fitness center was decent too.

However, all-in-all, we both agreed that we would never stay at the Setai again. It's off the beaten path, nice people but terrible service, especially in concierge and it's just not worth the money given the number of high-quality hotels in much better locations in the city.

I don't usually say this about many hotels but The Setai was perfect. Service at its best without an attitude found at other 5 star hotels.

Stayed here for one night before a cruise and strictly on the merits of TripAdvisor reviews. Beautiful hotel with large comfortable rooms for NYC. Loved the bar area with great bar food and drinks (although at $16 for cocktails, it is no bargain). The only issue we had was with the Dux bed would you believe. I have never slept on one and was excited that this was a feature of the hotel. It is basically a box spring with a thick mattress pad. Not exactly the cloud 9 experience we were expecting. But other than that, the room was very modern with a wonderful bathroom and high tech features. Another real bonus was the free mini bar amenities including a wonderful coffee machine and free bottled water. The price point here is definitely on the high end but the staff makes you feel welcomed and comfortable.

My husband & I stopped over in NYC for 3 nights and we got a suite studio in Setai. We were very disappointed in the following areas:
- I am allergic to dustmite and I am positive that my rooms have dustmites. I provided feedbacks and hope that the management made an effort to clean up the room. Considering the amount that we paid for the room and this is supposed to be a top hotel, I don't think dustmites are acceptable.
- The bed is too low and uncomfortable to sleep in. There are no spare pillows to make the sleep more comfortable. Accompanied with the dustmites, I did not manage to sleep much in my 3 nights.
- The furnishings looks good but the quality of the fixtures are not as expected. The toilet bowl is choked on our second day that we are there, the water pressure in the shower is too little which make showering difficult and the water pressure in the washing basin is too strong which cause the water to be splashed all over.

While I can understand that the occasional hipcups on the water pressure and toilet do happens, the cleanliness of the hotel affected the quality of my stay adversely. While I admit that I am "wow" initially by the huge room and the minimalistic design, the cleanliness really bothered me a lot. I hope they will put in more attention in the house-keeping area.

We regret that you did not find our Duxiana beds comfortable. They are reknown to provide the ultimate sleep experience and adapt to any required lumbar support.
Our Italian wood found throughout the hotel, Calacatta marble and Grohe bathroom fixtures are among the finest furnishings and accessories.
We have noted your comment regarded the water pressure which was caused by work being done by the City of New York.

We truly value your opinion and hope to welcome you back in the future. I remain at your disposal if I can ever be of any assistance.

There are two types of companies. Those who rely on their previous success and gradually let their performance faultier and those that continue to improve despite past success. The Distrikt clearly is in the latter category.

The one bad mark against them has always been the neighborhood which far from bad isn't free of its problems. Examples some bums, a porn shop, the parole board. However, since my last visit two years ago the neighborhood is changing. A new bar Beer Authority has taken over the corner of 8th and 40th offering a nice watering hole for guests of the Distrikt.

In summary, this once bad mark is slowly getting better.

The Distrikt staff remains its biggest strength. Friendly and welcoming every time my family entered or left the hotel. The room was always clean and comfortable. The hotel is centrally located for those who will spend much of their nights going to the theater.

Amy's Bread a great bakery is close by as well which is always a plus.

Overall great hotel.

The hotel is very well located, 5min walk from Times Square, 1 min from the metro.
The rooms have a good size, are very comfortable and clean.
It is very good to have the newspaper and the weather every day.
Our room was on the 32nd floor with view on the Empire State Building, and what a pleasure to see it every night before going to sleep.
I really like the iced tea after warm days of walk.
Don't hesitate to go there, the advises are true and you won't regret it.
Again thank you to the staff who made everything easy and perfect during our stay, we will come back here for sure.

'One year on and still excellent'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 5, 2012 NEW

I wrote a review of this hotel having stayed here last year and having now just returned from my second stay here I thought I would provide an updated review.

Having enjoyed my stay here last year, when booking this years trip, I dealt with the hotel directly to make the booking. The 7 nights stay was booked very quickly and I was given the choice to pay at the time of booking or at check in, this gave me the opportunity to keep an eye on the exchange rates secure the best rate I could when paying.

We arrived at the hotel and through the front door, it was good to be back. We were immediately welcomed to the hotel. There were a few guests in front of us, so we had a little wait, but nothing too long. Our suitcases were taken to the side for us whilst we waited. Whilst waiting, it was evident that the professionalism and level of service had not changed as the guests before us were being dealt with quickly by the very helpful front desk staff.

I am happy to report that the hotel is still as excellent as it was a year ago. When our turn to check in arrived, we were welcomed back, this being our second stay at the hotel. The staff member checking us in was very polite and processed us quickly asking if we needed anything, like a map of the city etc and was quite surprised when I said I still had a map from a trip some 3 years ago.

With door key in had we were ready to head to the room. Heading to the lift, we were asked if we needed assistance with our luggage, but having only small cases, we were happy to take these ourselves. Into the lift and heading to our room.

This year we were staying on 24th floor, in a City View room, the room was the same size as our room last year, which was on the 16th floor, this time we had a view of the Hudson from our window. I really like the rooms at this hotel, they are a decent size and very comfortable, with excellent amenities. The addition of the coffee/tea machines in the room is a plus, though I still prefer the fresh coffee in the lobby each morning.

The staff here are still very professional and always seem happy and nothing is too much trouble, whether that be asking for directions or making a reservation at a restaurant. The staff always have a smile and a welcome back / enjoy your day as you pass through reception.

The staff seem to be very proud to be a part of what makes the Distrikt Hotel such a special place and welcome comments about what is good / bad about a guests experience. This can be seen when a guest last year commented about not having coffee / tea facilities in the rooms and within a day or two every room had a machine.

Overall, I have had yet another excellent stay at the Distrikt and cannot recommend this hotel enough. I do not usually make return visits to hotels, but having had two excellent stays here, this is a hotel that I will not hesitate to return to, so much so that I am already planning next years trip.

If you're looking for a decent hotel in Manhattan, that offers a bespoke service, has excellent rooms, excellent staff and a great location, then this is it.

The hotel is still highly ranked here on trip advisor and that has to say something about the quality of this hotel.

This is a great hotel, which gives a level of service and experience that in my opinion you just don't find in a lot of hotels especially ones part of big chains.

If your thinking about staying here, do it, in my opinion, you won't be disappointed.

(not too soft-not too hard "just perfect"!).
After the hectic pace of New York the Distrikt was a welcome reprieve; pleasant, safe and very comfortable!

Free Internet is always nice, and having just 4 rooms on a floor meant a quiet night's sleep. Quick walk to Times Square, too.

I had spent some time reading hotel reviews on Trip Advisor before deciding to stay at the Elysee. We couldn't have asked for more. The service was efficient and friendly without being intrusive; our room was elegant, comfortable and super clean. It really did seem that a lot of thought had gone into the interior decor of the hotel generally and there were nice touches like the library where one could sit quietly and read. There was an atmosphere of friendly calm everywhere - an absolute delight. Just a tad noisy at night because of the air-con 'machinery' outside at the back of the hotel. We remedied this by sleeping with windows shut with the air-con on (it was quite humid). On reflection it might've been quieter taking a room at the front of the hotel, which we will do next time. In any event, it didn't spoil our stay which was wonderful.

I saw Hotel Elysee listed in a guide book as the most romantic hotel in NYC, so I decided to give it a try. My husband and I planned booked one of the most basic rooms that they offer, since the fancier rooms were beyond our budget. Several days before we were due to arrive, I received both a phone call and an e-mail from the hotel asking if there was anything that they could do to make our visit more enjoyable, such as arrange for tickets to a show or attraction, etc. How perfect that they reached out, because in fact there were two things that I was hoping for but had not yet made the effort to contact them about. How much I appreciated that they were proactive! One of my requests was to have a bottle of champagne on ice for us when we arrived, and the other was that I had been unsuccessful in obtaining tickets to the WTC Memorial and was wondering if they were able to assist. They took care of both of my requests immediately - they gave me a tip on the WTC tickets (which worked out, so we were able to go), and they had the champagne on ice waiting for us when we walked into the room. They also upgraded us to a beautiful suite that was larger than a lot of apartments in NYC! Amazing service and very welcoming.

The hotel is charming and lovely - traditional decor, beautiful bathrooms, and beautiful stenciled artwork on the walls in the hallways and stairwells. They offer complimentary breakfast and complimentary wine/cheese/snacks in the evenings. It is a great location, right in the heart of midtown and close to the subway. It was a good value for the money, particularly when you factor in the breakfast and the wine hour.

We didn't care for the Monkey Bar that is part of the hotel - we found it to be outrageously overpriced and nothing special. We also wouldn't bring our children to this hotel - it is more sophisticated. It was luxury without snobbery. The staff was very service-oriented and professional. We were sorry to leave, and we will definitely be staying at the Hotel Elysee again!

My wife & I have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Hotel Elysee which was chosen on the basis of the consistently favourable ratings awarded on this website. We were not disappointed - the quality of both accommodation & service exceeded our high expectations. The front facing room on the 14th Floor was excellent with the added, but unexpected, bonus of a balcony. Traffic noise was not an issue - we live in a quiet lane in the English countryside ! Staff in all departments were friendly, courteous & helpful. The quality of the continental breakfast was high & the 'club' style lounge an ideal environment in which to enjoy not only this meal but the complimentary beverages & cookies that are available throughout the day, together with the early evening wine & 'nibbles'. The hotel location is ideal - accessible to, but away from, the frenzy of the 'tourist centre' of the city, close to the subway & handy for Central Park. We will stay at the Elysee again when we revisit New York

We arrived very early and were invited to have coffee in the beautiful room on the second floor where complimentary breakfast, tea, and cocktails are served throughout the day. This little gem has the feel of a small intimate European hotel.

Our room was very comfortable and well appointed. We slept very well in our ninth floor room and we were not bothered by any noise.

The property is located on E. 54 street; between Park and Madison; perfectly situated for business, cultural events, shopping and dining.

We spent three nights in the hotel and can't wait to book our next trip.

It was quiet, spacious and elegant. We enjoyed our time in in the hotel very much. In addition that, the staff were so kind. I called the front desk in total frustration at 1:00am, as we had spent over half and hour trying to hail a taxi, and were seemingly stuck downtown. Instead of hanging up on me or laughing at me, the gentleman at the desk gave me great advice on how to best find a cab, as well as a pep talk. When we finally made it back to the hotel, he then offered me some candy. Now that is service! We are really looking forward to staying at the Hotel Elysee again.

It was sold out at the time of inquiry; thanks to popularity, May graduations & summer travel. Something told me to keep checking daily because when your heart desires something, you go for it. And sure enough, one day, the dates opened... thank you sweet karma.

Thank you Al, the first to greet us, so accommodating with our check-in/payment arrangements. A special shout out to Jubel, who greeted us coming & going with a genuine smile, great conversations and really made us feel so welcomed as if we were old friends.

And there's Charlie. The special kitty that came into our room at 5am when my boyfriend & I had a spat that evening. He came onto the bed, slept between us and stayed until we realized how silly we behaved. And as if his job was done, left regally out of the room.

Thank you CPI. You made our trip special.

Chelsea Pines Inn is a great quirky little hotel in the middle of a Chelsea street. The inside lobby is clean and modern. The rooms are an adequate size (I might have had to squeeze to get around the foot of the bed but it was never really any problem) but the beds are big and comfortable. The best part are the people running the place: Jay and Al were immensely helpful and pleasant and really made us feel at home. Everyone else from those running the front desk to those keeping the break area stocked (and it was always stocked with fresh items and little snacks) was absolutely courteous, professional, and happy to just chat about how things were going. Although the rooms are up some flights of stairs, the people working there moved our luggage for us. The noise from the street was never a problem, and I never heard anyone in any of the other rooms through the walls. The location was perfect for seeing local sights, and I have to agree with others here who say that the High Line is a must-see.

I would feel comfortable recommending this to anyone I knew, and I know they would come back raving about what a great place this was.

5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 31, 2012 NEW

My week-long stay at the Chelsea Pines in May 2012 marked my second visit to this charming boutique hotel near the Meatpacking District, High Line Park, and Chelsea Market. This is a very personal establishment; every member of the staff team relates to each guest not just as a patron customer but as a friend. This personal touch really pays dividends when you come inside the door, morning noon or night, and you are greeted warmly with welcoming conversation (and the staff has the sense to leave you alone if you appear to be hungover or otherwise under the weather). The festive atmosphere is contagious such that all the guests feel like included family, and the breakfast room and deck leading outside give travelers a place to come together and share their experiences. The all-day breakfast room, by the way, is a real highlight with the thoughtful inclusions of the complete gamut of what a Continental breakfast can be: Nespresso machine, a smorgasbord of teas and other beverages, luscious fresh fruits, high-end yogurts, sumptuous breads and pastries, imaginative cereals, even peanut butter (a personal favorite). I also like the fact that one can use the hotel's refrigerator to stash a bottle of wine or nosh. The establishment's silver screen theme is amusing and entertaining (i.e., in which movie star's room are you staying? Sophia Loren's or Rita Hayworth's or Albert Finney's or ??) All in all, this place is unique, distinctive and memorable, and I look forward to coming back again and again.

And who can resist sitting on the back patio in good weather having a 'many-options' breakfast, reading the paper, and hearing the birds sing (yes, this is NYC!). The Inn is very clean and well run. And for those of us who miss our pets when we travel, Charlie Chaplin, the resident cat, helps fill that need.

Finally, the location is fabulous. At the end of the block is the subway. The Highline (a 1.5 mile walk) is a couple of blocks away, as is the Hudson River. Small neighborhoods like Soho, Greenwich Village, and Chelsea, to name a few, offer unique shopping opportunities and are a short walk away.

You get a very different picture of what NYC can be like staying at the Chelsea Pines Inn: friendly and slower paced yet all the things you want to do are easily accessible.

Our room was small but immaculate, great bed, bath with toilet cubicle separated from the shower area. The highlight was the service, including encouragement to walk the High Line (a highlight of our visit) and help in getting reservations for the 9/11 memorial. Breakfast was VERY upscale continental, similar to what you get in a 3-star Italian hotel. Each person who helped us, from the owner, Jay, to the people who cleaned and maintained, had only one intention: warm hospitality. We were there as part of a Big Birthday celebration, and hotel staff helped family members surprise us with wine and chocolate-covered fruit. It's totally convenient to the subway, bus, and walkable to West Village and Chelsea, and even beyond. It was expensive, but fair market value for New York in that season.

I travel frequently to NYC for work, and have stayed at this hotel a few times in the past few years. My work colleague who travels even more frequently loves this place, and will not stay anywhere else. He finds it incredibly homey. I am not as much a fan. The style is cluttered -- overstuffed sofas that look "lived in" in the lobby, "distressed" wooden floors, chintz coverings. Sort of what you might find in a well-cared for English country house on PBS. I like minimalist design, and this is the opposite of that. In addition, there are times when the prices are upwards of $700 per night, which seems too crazy, even if it's on the company's dime. A few perks -- all snacks in the well-stocked mini-bar are free (which leads one to binge on tasty free chocolates), and there are full size shampoos, conditioners, moisturizer from trendy Red Flower in the bath. The Tribeca neighborhood is great -- lots of nice restaurants nearby.

I love this area of Tribeca as i used to live nearby in the 1990's. This quirky hotel has a suitably downtown vibe; all the rooms are different with the decor carefully designed to appear to have been thrown together with inherited furniture etc and the employees all seem to be 20 something chaps , all effortlessly neat,stylish and meaning well ( but not all that experienced in the tricky business of running a great hotel.) There is a great , dimly lit pool with a japanese feel in the spa. My main problem with this slightly expensive wondrousness is that it uses the next door restuarant , locanda verde for its catering and it doesnt open till 8 am which is useless for business travellers. The staff offer to get coffee/ food before then but they either forget whos responsibility it was to get it from the restaurant or the restaurant forgets etc. also, the lounge tables arent suitable for eating drippy poached eggs from ( they are knee height) and it all seems a bit of a bother for the staff. Overall then, a fine place to explore downtown from as long as you are not an early riser and as long as you realize that there is no catering that is owned by the hotel onsite.

In addition to my favorite restaurant there are good cocktails, and there is a private "drawing room" and patio in which to relax or order your meals from Locanda Verde. Very quiet. No hallway noise, and even if there was, there is a second door to shut off the hallway. The windows shut out all street noise. This is my new hotel standard.

The hotel describes itself as feeling more like someone's 'home' and that is exactly how it feels! There is such a warmth about it. The courtyard is nothing short of utterly beautiful. The drawing room is completely relaxing- especially with the log fire. They have used the space in the rooms well - I initially thought the rooms would be small but they are surprisingly large! The restaurant Locanda Verde is very good and has a great buzz. I will be returning to NY and this is the place I will go to.

This hotel is utterly outstanding. I've spent a lot of time in hotels in NYC and The Greenwich Hotel is now, without a doubt in my mind, the best. I'm pretty picky when it comes to hotels, but this one was almost flawless to me. It oozes charm, warmth, cleanliness, individuality, credibility and style, and most importantly provides in abundance; a sense of genuine care and respect for it's guests. It's not the cheapest hotel esp. if you want a slightly larger room, but you cannot help but feel you are paying for superb, maintained quality and complete attention to detail.

From the moment I walked in and was greeted by the fantastic reception staff, then met the attentive and friendly bartenders to whom I chatted with during lunch at the bar in Locande Verde, I immediately knew I had made the right choice to book a room and looked forward to two great nights of comfort and relaxation at this truly beautiful hotel. The doormen in particular are so charming and friendly, in a down-to-earth manner and they do their job to perfection.

The eye for detail at The Greenwich is wonderful. In the rooms the extensive free mini- bar (minus alcohol) and gratis large basket of candy and snacks are a great and welcome change to the norm; the bathrooms were luxurious, spotless and the quality and size of the excellent toiletries again were very welcomed and enjoyed. (Note: they even have a plastic zip lock bag for travellers to use for liquids in airports  the attention to detail here is really quite admirable). The beds were great and linen superb quality. My only gripe was the queen bed seemed pretty small and pillows a little on the thin side. But next time I will just book a king room and just request an extra pillow or two.

The private residents bar is another welcome feature and overall I would highly recommend this hotel. I look forward to returning to stay again.

It's possible there were events going on upstairs, though no one in my car stopped at those floors. It seemed like they just under spec'd number or elevator speed.

Trump SoHo is the best hotel I have stayed at in NYC. The location is great, away from the big tourist areas and walking distance from SoHo,the West Village and Tribeca. A very world class property with contemporary decor.. I travel a lot through JFK and the Trump Soho is only a short 35-40 miniute ride using the Airtrain & E train subway. The subway station is a half block away and is faster than a car from JFK especialy during rush hour. Try it once and you will be hooked. Don't forget to pack a swim suit the pool deck on the 7th floor is realy nice place to relax if you get tired of the city.

One of the best hotels in New York City and THE most comfortable bed in a hotel room you will probably find.
Service was spot on as usual and front desk is probably best in NYC as well.
Highly recommended.

After 3 hours delay and 8 hours flight from Spain i arrive with my family and a 9 month baby to the Soho Trumph Hotel at 11pm. We had late arrival so we should have the rooms and everything was paid, what was our surprise when we arrived to the reception desk and they sold our rooms... AMAZING! nothing to say, nothing to do, just shut up and move to other Hotel at 1am.

We had travelled around the world in every kind of hotels from 6stars to hostels and this first time ever happens, and in a place called Trump SoHo NY even worst.

If you plan to visit NY and you had book in this Hotel, make sure they have your rooms and they dont sell it to other client... Good luck and take care.

I have stayed in NYC multiple times in the last few years for work, and I have stayed at the Trump Soho at least 10 times. My most recent stay was in May 2012. This is an excellent hotel. One tip: if you book through the website, you can select an option to receive an upgrade to a suite based on availability for an additional payment per night (which turns out to be far less than the cost of booking the suite). I have gotten upgraded every time I requested it through the website. The suites are a real treat -- particularly the bathroom -- where the tub looks out a window. I have always had excellent service from the front desk and the staff. The only slight downside is that it has a slightly "corporate" or "generic" in terms of design. While everything is very luxe, it's not cutting edge design.

I've stayed at many Manhattan hotels and have generally been overwhelmed by the price and underwhelmed by the lodging. I expected the same from the Trump SoHo. However, from the minute my taxi pulled up to the hotel to the time I left, I was pleasantly surprised over and over. The doormen who greeted us were smiling, friendly and acted as though they truly enjoyed their job. Check-in was quick, with the attendant asking me if I'd like a complimentary bottle of water (yes, of course!).

The room was spectacular! Even though I was only on the 11th floor, I still had a fine view. Bathrooms, bed mattress, linens, towels...everything was spotlessly clean and top notch. Bathroom amenities included shampoo, conditioner, body wash, body lotion, shower cap, sewing kit, qtips and mouthwash. My favorite thing of all was the hair dryer. It was a Barbar dryer (never heard of it before). My hair never looked better. I'm buying one of those hair dryers pronto!

Turndown service was automatic and put the final touch on an excellent experience. When I returned to my room in the evening, there was soft music playing. The drapes had been drawn and a fresh pair of slippers placed at the edge of the bed. A square of dark chocolate and a fresh bottle of water was left on the nightstand. ANOTHER bottle of water and a filled ice bucket were left on the wet bar.

The level of service at this hotel was just so refreshing. And, greatly appreciated after a day of meetings and travel. I'll be calling this my little SoHo oasis from now on.

I really only write reviews when we fall in love with a hotel.
The number one thing to write about is the service. The concierge was very helpful and accommodating. I know this is the service you are paying for, but they went above and beyond. We were very happy with our stay and felt like we coming home each night. The hotel itself is very beautiful. We were on the 14th floor - suite with an amazing view. Breakfast each morning was very healthy and amazing!!! Pool area is nice with an outside dining area as well.

Bar at night was fun for pre-drinks and celebrity watching :)
The hotel car drivers were very nice and accommodating as well.

We happened to go to the Wilshire and Santa Barbara as well to dine. Four Season Beverly Hills was def. our favorite out of the 3. It's very quaint.

For Dinner we went to:
Cut - It was delicious of course and we got to meet Wolfgang Puck. I didn't see fish on the menu but was available if you asked for it. Make sure to have reservations

Madeo - Food was delicious here as well. Have a drink at the bar first and make sure to have reservations.

Red O - We love Mexican food so this was a great pic. They have tons of Margarita choices. Tamales and pork sope were good appetizers. The crab and shrimp enchiladas were amazing. My husband had chicken and beef tacos I believe. They were like Fajitas

The Ivy - This was actually our favorite food out of all them. We asked for a reservation of course. Make sure to get the homemade tortillas with guacamole. The fried chicken was good. I had the grilled salad with scallops that was amazing. The fried chicken was better :)

The house car will drive and pick you up at all these locations :)

What's fabulous is the service. The staff really, genuinely do far, far more than they need to to make your stay special. They spent hours organising and re-organising flights for us, and helping us dissect all the various restaurant options in the area (and their recommendations were great). Organising a taxi to collect us from a long walk ten miles away, on the dot of 9.30 in the morning, without really being asked was sensational.

It's worth every cent. We'll stay there next time we're in LA, no doubt at all.

My sister-in-laws and I were her for a weekend getaway. It was as good as it gets. The hotel is beautiful and clean. The staff is wonderful in all ways. It was like not having to do anything for yourself. You mention it and they will take care of it. We used the driving services and they were prompt and fabulous. We had spa services which were excellent. The spa facilities are relaxing and very accommodating. Everything was just good, the exercise room had some of the best equipment. The pool and jacuzzi were beautiful with flowers all around. I just can't say enough about how pleasant it was to stay here. If you get a chance to visit this area I would recommend giving this hotel a try. We did not have any problems, but I know that If you are not happy with something just tell them and if they can make it right they will. If you like a good, luxurious, clean hotel with wonderful service then this is the spot for you.

On our recent stay in LA we picked the Four Seasons in part because of its location in a peaceful residential area within walking distance of Rodeo Drive and surroundings and within a short drive to so many of our planned coastal visits. We also picked it because of the value of this hotel relative to other top-tier LA hotels. All that proved true when we arrived, however, we found that the thing that separated this hotel from the pack was the personable service that was attentive to every need and want wthout being fawning While I've stayed at finer facilities, I have never been treated better. The staff remembered our name and made us comfortable at every turn. A particularly nice feature is the house car limousine service which provides a comfortable magic carpet to local shopping, restaurants and sights. We also enjoyed tremendous treatment at the spa. The only negative we experienced were interminably slow elevators. A small price to pay for a truly elegant, enjoyable and restful experience.

We booked this hotel based on a recommendation. The staff were friendly, the hotel was quite & clean. The continental breakfast was excellent and the wine and chees during the week was much appreciated. Short walk to subway & midtown attractions.

We had to upgraded the room as soon as we arrived as the allocated room on the 5th floor was small, dark & only had one double bed for 2 female tourists. When we have been to USA previosly the Queens are 6ft wide & Kings are 5ft wide. In UK, Queens are bigger, in US Kings are bigger hence why all the confusion here. We moved to a room with 2 king-size beds & balcony on the 11th floor. It was WOW! but we did have to pay the extra fees as there was no jesture of goodwill from the management for the confusion.
We found the frosted glass panel on the bathroom door a slight shock at first, but it did not cause a problem. Would be quite happy to stay there again but would look at other hotels in this price range for a top floor room.

Dear nicci-ritchie,

Thank you so much for choosing the Hotel Giraffe. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay. We also thank you for your feedback and for giving us this opportunity to share some information with the TA community. For international travelers, you might wish to be aware of American mattress sizes: A Full or Double Bed is--54 x 75 inches (137 x 190 cm), a Queen Bed is 60 x 80 inches (or 153 x 203 cm) and A King Bed is 76 x 80 inches (or 198 x 203 cm). The room you booked had one Queen bed (our most affordable room) and the room you ended up with, which we were lucky to have available is a deluxe room with 2 Full size beds (our most spacious and highest priced non-suite room).

On our website and our booking engine, we offer this bed size information on the description of each available room type. We also include the bed size in the name of the room. We also offer photos and floor plans so that travelers can feel confident that they know exactly what they are booking. While we do not charge extra for double occupancy, we do charge extra if travelers prefer and select a larger room or a suite.

Regarding the bathroom door, the hotel was designed by a wonderful and innovative architect and interior design team, Stephen B. Jacobs and Andi Pepper, who won awards for the softly contemporary Hotel Giraffe design, however we can certainly appreciate that on occasion, some guests are not absolutely comfortable with the translucent door. We are always more than happy to paper the door for a guest on request to make them feel more at ease. I am sorry if you were uncomfortable even for a moment and I only wish we had known so that we might have resolved that for you while you were still in house. Perhaps, because you mentioned the issue here, we will have the opportunity to extend that service for one of our future TripAdvisor guests.

Please do let me know personally the next time you are coming to NYC as I would love to help you select the ideal room and high floor to suit your needs. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back soon. I can be reached directly at peter@hotelgiraffe.com.

Our only disappointment was the diminished privacy, in that the living area of the suite faced an air shaft and looked directly and closely into some office buildings. There were only shades and it was very dark with them down. It would have been nice if there were some sheer drapes to mitigate the fish bowl feeling. Same with the bedroom. There were only shades and you could see into the office buildings across the street. Sheers would have been helpful so that we didn't feel so self-conscious, yet had natural light in the room.

Just returned from a week in New York, staying at the Hotel Giraffe.
It is an excellent small hotel in the heart of the city. Very central for visiting all the main sites, and easy walking distance to many of them. Whilst it is situated on busy Park Avenue, it is a very calm and quiet place to relax inside the hotel. A simple but nice breakfast is served in the lobby....(as is a free cheese and wine event each day from 6:00pm to 8:00pm...a very nice touch). A fairly small but pleasant roof garden is open for evening drinks.
I would definitely recommend this hotel.

'Excellent Hotel, Excellent Value'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 28, 2012

I've stayed in many hotels in Manhattan. Hotel Giraffe is up there with the best of them, but at a fraction of the cost. Staff are polite and friendly, the room was bigger than expected for the City and in excellent condition. Free wifi worked great and breakfast was refreshingly simple and fresh. For a business traveller like me, they have got everything spot on to make a stay stress free and a pleasure. No question where I'll be staying there next time I go to New York.

'A Great Value, Staff and Comfortable'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 27, 2012

I have traveled regularly to NYC for several decades at all budgets. It is frustrating to try to find a place that is quiet, comfortable, spotless, with a great staff, updated and efficient for less than the cost of my monthly house payment. I think the Giraffe delivers on all of these. Too many well known hotels are simply noisy, a little frayed around the edges, have just OK staff. I can endure any of those things, but what is really bugging me these days is how hotels offer an attractive basic rate but then get you with service fees for everything. At the Giraffe all the basics are included. For example you will read numerous posts about the nice breakfast in the morning, the wine and cheese at night and then later cookies. I appreciate the free papers (NYT, WSJ) and free WiFi as well as little things like two free bottles of water in the room. (By comparison, I was just at the W in San Francisco and they charge you $4 a bottle in the room!). The beds and linens are extremely comfortable. Bedside is an iPhone docking station. The closet actually had enough space for my wife and I to hang everything for 4 days. We had 2 chairs for sitting in the room and plenty of space to move around (it was a King)
The staff was always pleasant and friendly. They all seem to really enjoy their jobs and working at the Giraffe. I will certainly return.

This is a comfortable hotel. It isn't a hip, boutique experience. There were many people from Europe, all ages and families.

The hotel can book a car service to JFK for $77 including fare, tax, tip. A cab can easily run you $55 and wont be as comfortable or ready for you.

The staff were very friendly and greeted us everytime we walked in the door. I will agree with another reviewer that the glass in the bathroom door was a little strange. I was staying in a suite with my brother and sister-in-law for my niece's graduation, so it was a little awkward.

I was only there for one night so it wasn't an issue, but this will add up awfully quickly for a family trying to stay here on vacation. There was nothing wrong with the hotel, but I give it an average rating because I generally expect a Westin to be a little higher end in room finishes and ammenities. The hotel felt like a perfectly decent business-class hotel, but nothing more special than that. That said, we drove to LA for the day and just needed a decent place to stay for the night, and this worked well for that and we were able to get a good rate ($100) for an LA hotel.

Service was poorly staffed. Only two people at the check-in desk at peak check-in time which meant a long wait. No one to help you with your bags.

Overall quality: not what one would expect from the Westin line of hotels.

My advice go to a "lower end brand" of hotel also on Century Blvd. where you can get the same level of service, free wifi and a free breakfast for fewer $$$.

I, along with my husband and 10 year old daughter stayed at the Westin LAX for a seminar 5/24 - 5/27/12. We stayed in Room 1021 on the 10th floor.

We parked at the front of the hotel and left the key with the valet while we checked in. Self-parking is $24.75 per day, Valet parking is $33 per day. There's also a parking tax of $1.00 per day.

The spacious room had a king size bed, two night stands with lamps on each. The bed had great pillows and blankets. Theres a sofa that can be converted into a sofa bed, an ottoman, and another side table and a floor lamp. Along the left side of the room was a long table section, starting with the coffee station with Starbucks coffee, a table lamp, desk area, telephone, and a flat screen TV, 3 drawers, a mini bar refrigerator, and more shelving. There's a tray of snacks that will be charged to the room if you eat any of the snack items. You do get one complimentary bottled water.

The mini bar refrigerator is called refreshment center, and there's a big sign that states 'Please make your selection carefully; any item removed from the refreshment center will be automatically billed to your room. Removing items from the refreshment center to store personal belongings will incur a $25.00 cleaning and re-stocking fee.' I had requested a mini refrigerator and unfortunately, none were available. So Isabel, who checked me in, gave me permission to empty out the refreshment center, so I can use it free of charge. Be careful because there are sensors and if you move anything, your bill will be automatically charged. So these charges showed up on my statement, and I had to go to the front desk to get them removed.

There's a large mirrored closet with an iron, ironing board, electronic safe, and two luggage valets.

The bathroom has a lot of counter space with one sink. There's a vanity mirror, hair dryer, tissue, and plastic cups. Toiletries include white tea aloe shampoo & conditioner, body wash, body lotion, two white tea aloe soaps in the shape of a leaf, and mouthwash. The shower had good water pressure,

Hanging on a hanger in the bathroom is a super soft white Westin robe to use during your stay. I requested two more, so we each had a robe.

In the rooms, high speed internet access costs $12.95 per day for 1.5 MB (email, web browsing), and $15.95 for 5 MB (streaming video, downloading.) You were given a roaming code so you can get wi-fi anywhere in the hotel. Unfortunately, every time I tried to enter my code, it didn't work. There's free wifi in the lobby for 45 minutes.

They have an outdoor pool and whirlpool on the 3rd floor. Hours are 6am - 10pm. It's a rectangular pool with depth ranging from 3 feet to 4 feet.

There's also a fitness room on the 3rd floor open 24 hours. It includes treadmills, cross trainer, stationary bikes, free weights, and weight stations.

If you don't want to eat at the Daily Grill restaurant, local places within walking distance are Taco Bell across the street and Carl's Jr. to name a few.

Before my stay, I contacted Heather Repinski in the Sales department at the Westin LAX. And she was able to offer me free wifi in my room, as well as a discounted self-parking rate of $10. This was fantastic, so I really appreciate Heather offering this!

As a Gold Preferred Guest, you get extra perks; you get to choose either bonus starpoints, free in-room internet access, or a complimentary beverage. Other Gold benefits are you get are 3 Starpoints per US dollar spent, which is a 50% bous over Preferred, upgrades to enhances rooms at check0in, and 4pm late checkout if available. The room was spacious, and with the Gold perks, I would stay at the Westin LAX again.

Our room on the preferred guest level was quite large (no view, but it was only one night) with a sleeper loveseat that could have accommodated a child had we traveled with one. The room was clean, the bed was the "heavenly" bed we expect and appreciate. Room service was too us within 30 minutes and was excellent. Our small dog was made over by the staff who offered a special bed (she has her own) as well as other guests. It was like returning to the home of long-time friend.

We stay in the Opera Suite on the first floor, complete with Grand Piano, a lovely balcony overlooking a sweet garden with a trickling fountain that lulls us to sleep, in this beautifully furnished flat. What quiet and privacy we enjoy in the evenings there after a busy day of business. If you want the feeling of "living" in a Brownstone, in what we consider the best neighborhood, you will adore this beautiful Bed and Breakfast.

My husband and I took a trip to new York to celebrate my birthday and up coming 10th anniversary. I had no idea where we were staying, he wanted to keep it a surprise. After we arrived at The Inn New York, I was beyond pleased with this surprise. We arrived a little after 6am and were greeting warmly and taken to our suite. I was instantly in awe of the charm and history of this quaint Inn.

We stayed 2 nights in the Library Suite and 3 nights in the Spa suite, and we fell more in love every day. From the delicious snacks, treats, and breakfast items left and replenished daily, the antique decor and helpful staff, we never lacked anything during our stay. It was great to be out in the city all day and then have a nice, quiet peaceful place to return to. I could honestly go on forever and talk about each detail of this beautiful Inn.

If you are looking to stay in the hustle and bustle of the city, staying in a large and busy hotel, then this place is not for you. If you are looking for somewhere quiet, comfortable (the beds are amazing!), clean, and unique to stay than this is the place for you. You are literally steps away from the subway station, and just a few blocks from central park.

When we return to New York someday, I know exactly where we will be staying, and I am looking forward to trying out the other suites!

My husband and I recently stayed for 3 nights in the Vermont Suite at the Inn NYC. I almost hesitate to write this review because it's one of the best kept secrets on the Upper West Side. However, we had such a fantastic stay and it's too easy to rave about the Inn. We are former residents of the UWS and were looking for something that reminded us of living there. We normally stay at the Beacon Hotel in the neighborhood, but we were unable to get a reservation. After some further searching, we found the Inn and it sounded exactly like what we were looking for. Our suite was luxurious, beautifully decorated, comfortable with lots of personal touches. The hospitality and host Elyn made us instantly feel at home. We had our own separate entrance to the Vermont Suite and the array of snacks, fresh cheeses, quiche and bottle of wine upon our arrival allowed us to settle in and unwind after our travel to the city. The location is on a beautiful street and within walking distance of both Central Park and Riverside Park, numerous cafes, wine bars, shops and other local area attractions (Lincoln Center, Museum of Natural History). Its also ideally located to the subway for easy access to Times Square, Theater District, etc. The bedroom is on the lower level and was so comfy and quiet and just what we needed after busy days of walking around. We felt like we lived there and didn't want to leave. We also had an opportunity to see several of the other suites at the Inn and they were equally as beautiful. I travel frequently for both work and pleasure and while this may be more expensive, it's worth it to have your 'own' place in the city rather than a tiny impersonal hotel room. It rates at the top of my list and you could not be more spoiled. We will definitely be returning to our other 'home' in the city soon.

Ruth, Ellen and their staff go out of their way to make your stay not only memorable but so special. They tend to your every need. Everything in the Inn is first rate- from the decorating to the cleanliness of the suites. The great detail that is shown down to the way the bed is made and the towels are folded - it's all five star. When we're in Manhattan, there never is a question as to where we would consider staying - it's always at the Inn. We've written before that everyone deserves to feel like a superstar celebrity at least once in their life - believe us, if you stay at the Inn - its the feeling you'll walk away with. We're already booked for next year.

We entered an old world styled suite that was absolutely homey and lovely. Since it was our anniversary, the Inn had put a chocolate cake with the words "Best Wishes" written in it. The kitchenette was fully stocked with wine, soda, cheese, crackers, coffee, tea, hot cocoa, muffins, bagels and more. The large airy bathroom had a jacuzzi tub, sauna, and a shower with plenty of room for two.
The Inn is located on the West Side, away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but still close enough to everything to make it easy to get where we wanted to go. I would absolutely recommend this wonderful home away from home for anyone who wants a quiet get away with all the perks of the big city!

If you're looking for the convenience of midtown Manhattan, but are trying to avoid the concrete and glass monolithic hotels typical of a metropolis then The French Quarter Guest Apartments is the place you want. In fact, even if you do enjoy the large hotel experience, The French Quarter is an ideal place to stay. A block and a half from the theatre district in Times Square, this charming hotel offers a memorable experience you wouldn't expect to find in Midtown. Clean, a tastefully decorated room, and all the amenities you expect in any hotel. Contrast the modern conveniences with this property's unique location  a look out the window on 46th Street and your view is framed with trees  the morning's are punctuated with the clip-clop of the horse drawn hansom cabs making their way to Central Park from their west side stables. Colin, the proprieter, is extraordinarily helpful and friendly, and assisted us in arranging transportation to an event. We stayed in Room 207, a beautiful room one flight up with a bay window sitting area overlooking 46th Street. A great room but it is a one flight walk-up, however, the hotel features elevator service to most of their rooms. If you stay be sure to visit Amy's Bread on Ninth Avenue between 46th and 47th for peerless baked goods and sandwiches.

Located on restaurant row making it a perfect location to experience some great restaurants and be walking distance to the theatres. Colin McCormick and his staff (Torrey, John and Stefany) are incredibly helpful and professional. They assisted us with show recommendations, restaurant reservations, and transportation. We felt like we were at home! We stayed in the two bedroom apartment and it was incredible. Great outdoor patio area, two separate bedrooms and pullout couch in living room, spotless bathrooms with L'Occitaine bath products in each bathroom, flat screen tv's in each room, tons of room for a NYC hotel, kitchenette with microwave, refrigerator, sink, keurig coffee maker. Daily continental breakfast is excellent; fruit, coffee, bagels, cereal, oatmeal, toast, etc. Highly recommend this hotel whether you are one person, a family, or larger group. They have rooms of all shapes, sizes, and prices...you won't find better! We will stay in the French Quarters every time we visit the city!

The French Quarters Guest Apartments is a fantastic little hotel in midtown Manhattan -- a few blocks from Times Square. If you're visiting NY to see the traditional tourist sights, this is a great spot to stay. It is just a few blocks from Times Square, most Broadway (and off-Broadway) shows, Rockefeller Center, 5th Ave, etc. Central Park is also close - maybe a 10-15 minute walk.

The hotel is on a great street, surrounded by restaurants. On the weekends, it can be a little noisy (NYC never really sleeps) but, as we had the 2-bedroom apartment on the 4th floor, it wasn't a problem.

The apartment itself was excellent. The room was clean and in great condition. There was a master bedroom with a king(!) bed and a private bathroom. The other bedroom had a queen bed and a shared bathroom off the central living room area. Both the bathrooms are nicely appointed -- shower only, but that was hardly an issue for us. There were flat screen televisions in both bedrooms, as well as plenty of layers of bedding; perfect for all temps. The living room also has a flatscreen TV (with built-in DVD player) and plenty of seating for 4. The kitchenette had a microwave, refrigerator, Keurig coffee maker, and sink -- great for snacks (I'm not sure why you'd want to eat in the room with all the fantastic restaurants in NYC). The balcony is also great, providing a wonderful view of the street and surrounding midtown buildings (as well as the lights of Times Square).

The included breakfast is functional - not amazing but still a great way to start the day (and it's included). All the basics are covered: cereal, bagels/croissants, fruit, hard-boiled eggs, and yogurt (including organic Greek, which was excellent).

The staff is nice and helpful. The only negative thing, for some, would be the elevator. It is, quite possibly, the slowest elevator in NYC. It's easier to take the stairs (except if you have your luggage). If stairs are a problem, and you are impatient, keep that in mind. Otherwise, it's really no problem.

As we'll be back in NYC soon, we most definitely will look at the staying here again. Highly recommended.

This past weekend I had the perfect NY weekend, starting with the French Quarters Guest Apartments. The rooms were warm & inviting, impeccably clean, very comfortable beds and a personalized welcoming note from the General Manager, Colin McCormack. Colin and his staff were charming and very helpful!
The location is great for the close proximity of the theaters, Times Square and many restaurants. I would highly recommend this property to all family, friends and business acquaintances.

I was greeted by Colin McCormack when I arrived and have never met a more personable hotel manager. The front desk staff escorted me to my room, explained where everything was, and was great throughout the stay. I stayed in room 402; the entire suite was spotless and there is a large balcony to enjoy (definitely check out the city all lit up at night from there). The beds were comfortable, there were tons of pillows, and the televisions all have dvd players if you'd like to stay in and watch a movie. The location is perfect if you'd like to see a show or have a nice meal. Give the French Quarters a try and you'll be pleased with your decision.

The hotel itself has an old-fashioned charm; our room had one complete wall of bricks, a fireplace, and picture window. The hotel staff even sent up a handwritten note welcoming us to the hotel. The room and bathroom were clean and well maintained. The only cons of the room were the size (slightly small) and a bit of noise (poor sound insulation from the hallway); however given the price paid those were not significant setbacks. The best part of the hotel was its location. Although it is a couple blocks from Times Square, it's on a strip of restaurants and bars that are very active on the weekends. Also, the staff is excellent, as they were more than willing to help us arrange to hold our bags after we had checked out.

Overall, a lovely hotel right in the heart of New York. First off, the location cannot be beat! Right across from "Book of Mormon" (Eugene O'Neil Theatre), next door to "Chicago" (Ambassador Theatre), and right around the block from Times Square! Also next to great food options, including E&E Grill (where you get 10% off when you stay at the Pearl!).
The room was spectacular! No view, but the interior was spacious, clean, and very comfortable. The beds were very nice (although our full-beds might have been a little small), and I loved the showers (waterfall shower heads - directly above you)!
In terms of service, I was a bit disappointed. Check-in was nice, although I would have appreciated a smile from the Front Desk staff and help with our luggage. Doorman was friendly, but he was there at intermittent periods. Very disappointed with the breakfast. Nothing but some fruit, coffee, tea, and oatmeal still in the packet. All of this with plastic silverware and cups did not give me a good impression. However, the concierge was nice enough to recommend a nice place right around the corner (Pigalle), so I do give them credit. The housekeeping was excellent, and I have no complaints in that area. The service was not bad, it just needs some improvement.
Like I said before, this is a great hotel and for the prices in New York, it's a great value. I would highly recommend it. I would stay at this hotel again when I return to New York.

Took a chance but saw the reviews on Trip Advisor. A little more expensive than the Sheraton where our conference was supposed to be but it was close enough that it didn't matter. The hotel is in a great location. Across the street is the Book of Mormon musical while on the left was the Chicago musical. On the right was the Actor's chapel so if you are Catholic, you can hear an anticipated mass at 11 pm on Saturday night, just after a Broadway play, so you can wake up late on Sunday morning. The breakfast buffet was simple but decent. Staff was very accommodating and friendly while the room was perfect. The EE restaurant served a very good steak and they made sure our dinner was done so we could catch our play on time. There is a discount in the restaurant when you are checked in. Times Square was nearby and we felt safe in our room. I would stay here again.

we just returned from a 5 night stay at The Pearl and had a great time. For first time visitors the location was great, just half a block from the hustle and bustle of Times Square yet removed enough that it was a quiet oasis at the end of the day. My husband, sister and her husband stayed in a 2 bed room with a patio. The patio was all walled in but it was nice to have the extra space to hang out on while others were getting ready. I had emailed requesting the two beds be queens and we were happy with the size of the room for the four of us. We we on the second floor right by the location where the breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese were held but never heard the guests in the early mornings and it was super handy to run over to grab a quick coffee and breakfast every morning. We also took advantage of the wine a couple of the afternoons and that was a nice touch to unwind from our hectic days before heading in to get ready for the evening. All the staff were friendly and helpful and we are very glad with the choice we made to stay at The Pearl.

The only minor item is that when the AC cycles on at night, I could really feel the draft - but that would not deter me from staying here again. This is an excellent choice for the Times Square area.

3. Staff couldn't have been more professional or friendly if they tried.
4. Extra special elements - the comfy 24 courtesy bar drawing room.
5. Allocating us a room in the evening, hours after we checked out to shower and change after being caught in the rain.

Although we live in NYC, my family and I spent Christmas at the Crosby St. Hotel. We checked in very early on Christmas Eve since I had to go to work, and were pleasantly surprised to find that the rooms were ready, which started our weekend off on the right note. i was able to unpack and have breakfast in the bar before heading off to my job.
On the return, we had a lovely afternoon tea in the sitting room - with Ruinart Champagne, don't miss it - and our server was extremely gracious and knowledgable. Meals in the bar on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day (as well as breakfast on Boxing Day) were thoroughly enjoyable.
The design aesthetic of the rooms is in keeping with Firmdale, although I will say that the rooms are showing some wear. We booked two luxury doubles. A nice touch was the full sized candle given to each of us on Christmas Day.
The only let down was with check out. I was paying for both of the rooms, and although I had settled my account, one room was never transferred to the other and approximtely $1500 was held on my debit card. I'm not sure what it is with Firmdale, but they never process my bill correctly.
Overall however, this was a very enjoyable Christmas made all the more pleasant by spending it in a service oriented, boutique hotel that manages to capture the spirit of London in New York City.

My husband and i stayed at this place and were very disappointed. They put us in a room next to a room w/ wall sanding going on at 9:00 am!!!!! We called the front desk and were told that it was a vacuum cleaner. It was not a vacuum cleaner! It was a sander! We recorded it, and boy was it loud!
So, for $700 a night there should have been NO sanding at all! Front desk admitted but did not make any kind gesture to make up for this. Bad business.
We will not return! : (

We stayed there with our teenage daughters (who were in a seperate room). The room was spacious and well fitted out. The bathrooms were absolutely sublime. The staff were extremely professional, competent and obliging (to say the least). It was an excellent place to recharge from the frenetic pace of the city. Could not recommend The Crosby highly enough!

For the past two years, my wife and I have enjoyed New York City during the holiday season between Thanksgiving and Christmas. While I was there for business, my wife has accompanied me and we have always added a few days for holiday shopping. The Crosby Street Hotel decks itself out in its holiday best and its staff is part of this holiday cheer. It's warm and cozy, quiet and convenient. Even without my business trip, my wife would still book the Crosby.

Rooms are quiet, beautiful, NON-shabby chic, great environmental controls (excellent A/C), extremely comfortable beds, flat screen TVs with video inputs (for the techie geeks) with large windows and great bathrooms with (only) shower with powerful water flow! The staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating. The breakfast was your choice of anything: the steak & eggs were phenomenal-huge portion set us up for a whole day of walking the city! The buffet of yogurts, berries, fruit, muesli, cereals, bagels, toast, plus one may order tea service or coffees of any variety. We will definitely return, if the budget allows!

What's great: Rooms are beautiful & spacious, Floor to ceiling windows, hot shower & lovely amenities.
What's bad: The Staff, smelly bed & pillows, price.
I booked the CSH based on photos & location, which more than met my expectations. However, the staff was horrible. Polite, but not helpful at all. Housekeeping broke the shade while we were out to dinner despite having a "do not disturb" tag on the door. When I called to have it fixed and ask why housekeeping came into my room even tho I left the DND sign, the concierge blamed me for the shade & never alerted maintenance, so after 3 calls, the maintenance man finally arrived. The housekeeping question was ignored even though i asked 3 times. We requested a wake up call which never happened & when we expressed our frustration to the front desk, they desk clerk said flippantly "sorry".
The bed & pillows STUNK, like dirty hair-I'm guessing housekeeping never heard of Febreze, but they did come in uninvited to break the shade & fold the toilet paper into an arrow....

For $700 a night, I expect a better experience. The staff is unnecessarily snooty & apathetic, and in my opinion, incompetent. They smile & say hello, but no one went above those mild pleasantries. The stink was also upsetting, as I had Client appointments in the room & ever client remarked on the odd smell.

The restaurant is not much better. overpriced & painfully slow. The Caesar Salad is good, tho. Go to Balthazaar for an amazing meal or head down to Lomardis if you want affordable pizza. The Crosby Bar is disappointing for the price.

For $700 a night, I would expect a doorman or someone to help carry bags inside. I also expect a room not to stink, and for the hotel staff to do their jobs. It's a shame, it's such a beautiful hotel & a great location, the staff ruined my experience.

The staff at the hotel went above and beyond the service you get at most high end hotels -- they were very friendly and accommodating! Arriving to a friendly host and a glass of wine was a nice way to start off the weekend on Friday night. We had a splash suite which was spacious and lovely -- and had a magnificent view of the Public Library. Will definitely stay here again on our next trip to NYC.

We had a suite which was big, comfortable and nicely laid out.
The hotel is sort of a mix between a hotel and a condo.
Nice touches with the free coffee/wine.
I think all that needs 'tweeking' is the staff who greet you and then it would be perfect

This was a special occaison since I was proposing, so I had been emailing the hotel for a few weeks before we arrived for suggestions on making this extra special. Amanda coletta could not have been more helpful and I cannot praise her enough on what she did to help us. I would like to mention Joe also who was also a great laugh, not just because he kept filling my wine glass during the 'free' happy hour each evening in the reception.

Their gym is accessible 24 hours a day, which is great for guests traveling from a different time zone.

Coffee is ready in the lobby every morning, and wine is offered every evening. It was raining during our trip, so umbrellas were offered at the door for guests. Staff members flagged down cabs when it was pouring outside. I'm very appreciative of all the hard work the staff puts in. Kudos to them. We thank you for your service.

We were excited to stay at the Nolitan because of all the great reviews. When we arrived we were dissapointed to find that the rooftop and restaurant are essentially non-existent..on top of that when we got to our city view balcony room it was TINY. I understand NYC hotels are small, especially in the boutique group, but this was really small. For the price tag the hotel just did not deliver. Even the rooms looked sort of tired for a newer hotel.

The biggest warning and turn off was that they tried to get us to pay for an upgrade at check in. I actually almost took them up on the offer as it was only $35/night and we could get a king room. On second thought however I decided to stick with our original booking. I am glad I did - when I looked online to see what the difference in the upgrade offer room was and our booked room it was actually CHEAPER!!! They tried to get us to pay for a downgrade! I feel so uncomfortable about this. I also heard them trying to upgrade the people who came in after us.

On checkout I asked the gentelman who checked us in about his offer and asked him why he was trying to get us to pay more for a downgraded room - he said he was offering a better room on a higher floor but we were already staying in a city view. When i told him that he said he was offering a corner room - it would have made sense but I specifically asked when trying to decide if we should take the offer if it was a corner room he was offering - he said No - just a king room and the only difference would be the size of the bed.

Maybe it was a mis-understanding but it just isn't settling well with me. BEWARE of this tactic - it's a trick.


I will say the people were friendly and service was good too - unfortunately not enough to make up for the other short comings.

I truly apologize for your recent experience and can understand why the matter, of the upgrade, is unsettling. After speaking with the Guest Service Agent, that checked you in, I assure you that this was a genuine mistake. He mistakenly read the room type booked as a Neighborhood Balcony room, which offers a $35 upgrade to a Cityscape King, rather than a Cityscape Balcony. As a result of this incident, we are implementing an additional feature in our reservation system to safeguard these types of mishaps.
With regards to the restaurant and rooftop, we strive to make mention of the restaurant renovation and rooftop use at every opportunity including both on the website and email confirmation as well as the pre-arrival message. However, thank you for the opportunity to review our current status for all. At the moment, we are developing a new restaurant concept that we hope to launch by mid-summer. In the meantime, we are offering a complimentary continental breakfast in our restaurant daily and seamless in-room dining by collaborating with our neighborhood restaurants for delivery service. As for the rooftop, it is open to guests to take in the breathtaking views or for private events.
With respect to the quality of the rooms, I was saddened to hear that they were perceived as tired. The entire team takes great pride in servicing the hotel and while we have received excellent feedback about the condition of our rooms, your feedback is extremely valuable and our team will take extra measures to ensure that guestrooms are in pristine condition.
If you would like to discuss the matter further, I would be delighted to hear from you. Please feel free to contact me directly at 212.925.2555 or Jennifer@nolitanhotel.com.

Instantly, you feel like you are family. Kudos to Felix, and all the others! The hotel has a very nice contemporary design. Sure, the rooms are small, but that's typical for NYC rooms. It's just a few blocks from Little Italy, Soho and a subway stop. All the things you need for a stay in lower Manhattan. The continental breakfast is standard danish, yogurt, bagel variety, so nothing special there. The chocolate turn down treats are delicious. The staff alone rates up along side my experiences at Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton.

The rooms here were very small and the balcony overlooks ugly, busy Kenmare street. The Nolitan didn't do anything wrong necessarily, but they didn't do anything right either. Stay at the Mondrian, the Bowery or the Standard EV instead. Same price, MUCH better experience. This place is ok if you really just want a small, boxy, clean room in a good neighborhood. If you want to step into another world, go elsewhere.

There was a tapping noise on our first night, not only did they move us without fuss, but when we returned from dinner, they had left a complimentary bottle of wine on the side.

The bar was not open when we were there, although we were told it would be open soon. This is not really an issue in NoLiTa, so many good bars and restaurants about.

Very impressive, would definitely return.

She was able to assist with a couple of much needed reservations. Darren, the manager, is great and accommadating. I would definitely return, as well as recommend this hotel to anyone.
By the way, the hotel is very close to Times Square and 5th avenue. Bryant Park was across the street. Plus Bryant Park Grill provided good, easy access food and drinks. Additionally, the Koi restaurant on-site is definitely worth a try; Fantastic!

We chose the Bryant Park because of the location, which we'd liked on a previous visit to New York. It's a fantastic looking building, overlooking the small but charming green space of Bryant Park, right by the Central Library, on the edge of the garment district, a few blocks from Times Square and Broadway. It's not particularly quiet though with the busy 6th Avenue nearby.

Friendly staff greeted us in the lobby and were helpful throughout our 2 night stay. We checked in early after a midday arrival at JFK and were found a nice corner room, with an excellent view of Bryant Park and 6th, that was an upgrade from the "Superior" room we'd booked. The dim lighting and red-leather padded cell effect in the lift was a little weird!

Excellent bar downstairs, particularly between 5pm and 6pm when drinks are complementary for guests! The staff were pleasant and helpful if a tad underdressed (I think I'm getting old!). We went to Koi restaurant, entrance in the lobby, one night and thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere.

Not a huge room, but a good size for NY with an excellent bathroom with both shower and bath. Plenty of fluffy towels, face cloths, excellent toiletries, bathrobes and slippers. The bed was very comfortable with superb down pillows (you can ask for foam if preferred). Excellent large screen TV, Bose radio and CD, and dock for MP3 players (not an iPod dock though).

To me, a light sleeper who doesn't like background noise, the only downside was the constant drone of the aircon, even when the fan was turned off. The odd noise making machine next to bed supposed to provide soothing backround noises didn't help. The earplugs provided did, a little. Because of that and the traffic noise, I probably wouldn't come back, which is a shame as otherwise I really liked this hotel.

The room was fabulous... at least 6 windows made it bright and airy, the beds were heavenly, and the bathroom was wonderful. The staff was always helpful and on Mon-Fri afternoons, there is free open bar in the hotel's Cellar Bar for hotel guests. We both agreed this is where we would be staying on our next visit.

I go to NYC regularly - both for business and for romantic getaways with my boyfriend - and I always stay at the Bryant Park. I have never been disappointed. The hotel is excellent in all ways!
The location cannot be better: not too far up north nor south, a few blocks only to the 5th avenue shopping, a few blocks only from Times Square, easy to get in and out from Manhattan to Newark, the area around Bryant Park is wonderful and quiet (!), AND you almost don't hear the traffic (very unusual to escape that sound or the sounds in sirens in NYC...but at the Bryant Park you do!)
The rooms are great: clean, spacious and bright with views of the park (I always stay in a Deluxe room, or a Bryant Park suite). I love that the floors are wooden (I hate carpets in hotel rooms!), love the large bathroom with its Molton Brown ameneties, and the huge tub! Wi-fi usage is complementary and it is super easy to get connected (you don't need to fill in names, passwords etc).
Service is excellent! All staff is very friendly and helpful, and I appreciate that they don't "hang over your shoulder" all the time, or trying to convince you to take the luggage to your room when you arrive (as they do at the Ritzes of the world). As a guest you always feel that you have your privacy, but if you need the staff they are always there to assist you.
I'm a frequent traveler and normally stay at luxury 5-star hotels from Leading Hotels, since I'm very picky when it comes to hotel rooms....But in NYC I would never think about staying somewhere else than at the Bryant Park!

'Brilliant Hotel in an Excellent Location'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 28, 2012

My now fiance and I (we got engaged on the Monday while we were there)stayed in this delightful hotel at the beginning of May. We have to say this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in and would not think twice about staying anywhere else if we returned to NYC. The Hotel itself has an old world look to the exterior but very modern and almost Boutique look to the interior especially the lobby and main reception, we loved every part of the dcor.

The Staff were always very polite and attentive also they were extremely knowledgeable and it seemed as no request could be impossible to service. The Cleaner (maid) was brilliant, full clean up in the morning and even a turn down on an evening whilst we were visiting the many restaurants and bars around the hotel.

I understand that the hotel rate per night is not the cheapest in New York. However, there aren't many that can top this hotel for location. Nestled to the rear of the Library Building adjacent Bryant Park on a quiet street between 5th and 6th Ave (as quiet as you're going to get for Midtown New York). So if you take into consideration staying here you can walk to 90% of touristy places (Times Square, Empire State, Rockefeller Centre, Maceys all within 10mins walk) therefore you don't need taxis or the subway the cost doesn't seem that bad. Also, when you factor in the Complimentary Bar Service in the Cellar Bar between 5-6pm for residents is a brilliant idea, and one I'm sure would be a great plus point for much of the Brits staying here, the Rate becomes almost reasonable ;-)

The other plus points about this hotel was the large bathroom with great shower and MASSIVE Bath, just what you need when you've been peddling round Central Park all day. The only Negative I could say is that we had a room round the back of the hotel on not a very high floor, there wasn't any issue with noise from the streets below. However, the view could have been a little better than brick walls. However, you could argue that you aren't in the room for that long anyway and if you are really bothered about a better view then you would pay for a better room.

Bed was very comfortable. Very large bathroom with separate bath and shower with Molton Brown products. Only single glazed windows, so a little noisy from traffic, but it is New York. Ipod dock of sorts in room. Only had the stereo plug, not proper docking connection, so bring your charger. No tea and coffee facilities in the room. Drinks were complimentary downstairs in cellar bar for hotel guests from 5.00 to 6.00pm Monday to Friday. Very trendy bar and a lovely touch. Service at the hotel was prompt. Location was good. Only ten minutes walk downtown to Macy's shopping area and about the same over to Time Square and the theatre district. Subway station out on the corner. If you are seeing Sister Act, it's up on 57th street. Catch the subway two stops and it takes you door to door. Overall would rate the hotel 4.5 out of 5. Quality of sleep let it down a bit, but other than that very good, clean and recommended.

My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel on May 9-13th and we absolutely would recommend it to NYC travelers! The location is wonderful, short walk from Times Square and right in the middle of the city, overlooking Bryant Park. I think Bryant Park was one of my favorite parks, so pretty and well taken care of! The hotel staff are so accomodating and friendly, the front office manager, Robert Falco, was so very helpful and even said to get ahold of him for our next visit for a room that overlooked the city, now that's customer service!! The restaurant in the hotel, Koi, was yummy and even did last min reservations for us on a Sat. night! We never tried out the cellar bar, but it had a line to get in on a Sat night, so it must have been a good time! The hotel is not very noisy, even though one of the things they have in the bathroom was earplugs, which I had never seen before! My husband and I will def stay here again, we loved it and it made our trip that much more fantastic!!!

The Waldorf Towers; The pinnacle of luxury in old world Manhattan.... not. The service was horrible along with the building.
It's a dump!! The molding by the tired in-room bar was ready to fall off. It was discreetly wedged in rather than fixed. The amount of deferred maintenance is astronomical.

The service we received for the tariff we paid to stay in this dump was just a ugly as the condition of the building. Upon arrival, no one showed us to our room or even the elevator. It was as though we were to fend for ourselves for a rate $500 a night. When we would walk in and out of the hotel not one staff member ever even greeted us or acknowledge our mere existence! Not a even a smile. It was an extraordinarily impersonal hotel experience, no one knew our names or made us feel welcomed. When I called for a tooth brush it took four calls and 45 minutes. This is unacceptable at a holiday inn for god sake! Their explanation was rude and a women stated that, "We have 1700 rooms and we dont have enough time to get there that quick". Meanwhile, the description of the Waldorf Towers leads customers to believe that they are paying to be in an exclusive, 188 room alcove of the Astoria where the service and attention to guests is impeccable. To say that the staff in the Waldorf Towers is attentive is the anthesis of the truth. It is a scam!

The maid service and women who worked at breakfast seemed unenthusiastic and sent the message that you were always inconveniencing them. They never smiled. The women cleaning one of the tables at breakfast even said to a colleague, "If these people want to make such a mess and eat so much, just go to the Palace". I fortuitously heard the conversation from a few tables away. I was shocked to say the least.
I go to New York about 5 or 6 times a year and have stayed at over 10 hotels, some better than others.
This one happened to worse than all of them.
The Setai and The Palace are the best. They deserve your business.

The combination of best-in-class service with the authenticity of this 1920s designed grand hotel made it perfect choice for our long weekend of broadway shows and art museums! With all of the fantastic things to do in the city, i have a hard time pacing myself and taking time to recharge my batteries. We booked a regular room in the towers and got upgraded to a 2 room suite with perfect view of Chrysler building. If I had a rich aunt with an apartment in the city, this is what it would be like. Style and service is definately of another era. And l don't feel like I'm missing out on doing stuff in the city by just relaxing in my room. Rather than being "on the go" from morning to night, I've a few hours in morning and afternoon just hanging out in the suite or quietly wandering around the halls, lobbies and ballrooms of the hotel. I hope to come back here again in the fall.

The Towers has its own entrance, its own concierge and check in desk and breakfast restaurant, thank god because just walking through the Waldorf Astoria will have you running for a quieter, less frenzied hotel. The Towers is old fashioned, sophisticated charm and service. The rooms are comfortable full of elegant antique style furniture and large bathrooms with separate showers. We both agreed though that the room needed a fresh coat of paint and a general update. When we phoned down for slippers, towels etc they came up within minutes, nothing was a problem. Breakfast for the Towers is served in its own little restaurant, a choice of fruits, meat, cereals etc, but nothing hot or to order. You can also have afternoon tea here, which is included in the room price. It was great to have a separate concierge desk too, because we saw long queues in the main lobby. It's a very comfortable hotel, but it's not young and funky and neither are the clientele, but if you want a good location and elegant, old fashioned surroundings then this is the hotel for you.

The concierge (Michael) arranged a reservations for 2 very good restaurants (Co op and Standard Grill) for the next days, which was really great. In terms of localization the hotel is also good, as it is in walking distance from Madison Ave., Central Park and other nice places. I would definitely stay here again and recommend.

I have stayed in most of the nice hotels in NYC except, until this week, The Waldorf Towers. The Towers has a well-known illustrious history, from Presidents to Kings to Mrs Douglas MacArthur. One's perception of the Towers may be that of a past its prime, dowager of a hotel. Well you would definitely be wrong. The hotel and rooms, while very last century in style (I don't mean that negatively, but rather as in very elegant) are in excellent condition and spacious. The high ceilings and uncrowded common areas give you the sense of being cosseted in a private cove in a very busy city. It feels very much like you are in the comfortable quiet confines of a pre-war Park Avenue apartment (which you are). The separate entrance sets the tone, and it doesn't stop. The exclusiveness of the Towers and the relationship with the employees feels more like a co-op residence rather than a hotel guest experience.
Now, while there are a few hotels that offer this level of luxury - the Carlyle, the Pierre, the St. Regis, etc. what I like about the Towers is that you also have all the features and services of a large hotel just a few yards away in the main hotel. Also, the location - just a couple blocks north of Grand Central - is really ideal.
I will definitely make the Towers my first choice of NYC hotel going forward

Stayed here as a family for a week a Easter to celebrate a special anniversary and were very kindly upgraded by the lovely Abir for our stay. Huge two bed suite it felt like our very own apartment on Park Avenue. Very luxurious rooms with amazing linen/towels etc. Great breakfast room (and compliments to the girls working there) it is a small room however we were never waiting more than 5 minutes. Lovely selection of breakfast in particular the cinnamon granola.
Beautiful lobby, bars and great concierge service in the Towers. Recommended some good restaurants and some casual ones when travelling with teenagers. Don't bother with the Starbucks in the hotel its madly expensive. There is a great one opposite the main door of the Waldorf. This was our first trip to New York as a family and we will certainly never forget our stay at the Waldorf!!
If you are travelling with teenagers I highly recommend the Pizza Tour of Brooklyn (book in advance) it takes you to Coney Island too and it was one of the highlights of our trip.
If u get tired of 5th Avenue (because at weekends it does get hectic) shop in Soho or Seaport.
Less hassle and if the weather is nice you can take a walk/bike ride across Brooklyn Bridge (at Seaport) or sit outside and sip a white wine while the teenagers shop!!
We will be back to the Waldorf. Some day!
ps. lots of SUV's outside the hotel offering great rates back to the Airport. 90 dollars all in for 4 of us and 8 pieces of luggage

'Best Place I've stayed in NYC'

I've been to NYC almost 10 times and the last 3 times, I've stayed at The Beacon. I don't know if I'd ever want to stay anywhere else. The location is perfect. It's right by the subway. There's a market right across the street and a trader joes right down the road. Of course, there's a Starbucks right downstairs. The neighborhood is so lovely and makes you feel more like a local than a tourist. It's not so loud and busy like the hotels in the touristy parts of NYC. The upper west side is just a fabulous place to stay!

Also, the rooms are amazing. They're not your typical shoe box sized hotel room in the city. There's a living room along with the bedrooms and a little kitchen and great sized bathroom. It's like a little apartment. It's great for larger groups!

The staff is all very helpful and so nice! They seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs and are always ready to help.

I love The Beacon!

The room was well maintained throughout our 5 night stay. I would return without hesitation.

It's a great place. I'll always check to see if there is room at the Beacon when I come to NY. Perfect location and near the subway for easy access all over town.

'Great Place to stay on the UWS'

We stayed in a double room and was pleasantly surprised. The room looked exactly like the hotel photos -- was clean, beautiful, and very functional.

The room is good size for NYC (small by other cities' standards), and had a small kitchenette with toaster, coffee, microwave, stove, etc. Quite handy. So often in NYC the rooms are so small there's no room for additional seating, but this had a really comfortable chair for reading, and a small table with 2 chairs for eating.

I love staying on the UWS instead of in Times Square. Hotel Beacon is very close to the 72nd street subway--which has an Express 2/3 train to Times Square for touristy stuff. There's lots to do right in the UWS; a short walk will take you to the Lincoln Center (Ballet, Philharmonic, Opera, Musicals), the New York Historical Society (well worth a visit if an American history buff), and the Natural History museum/ Planetarium.

Definitely recommend.

Our room faced the back, but we still have a view over the rooftops. It was very quiet at night.

The staff are incredible, thay remembered me from previous visit 12 months earlier,they offer so much information, so helpful and very friendly, we were going to walk to the area behind the magic Castle to the Japanese restaurant, but they said the hill was a hard walk. no worries they drove us up there and we walked back down. beautiful and great views. easy walk ti everything you want to see in Hollywood, and there is a train station nearby. I recommend this to everyone I know that is going to L.A.

My family and I (from Australia) stayed at the Magic Castle from May 19 - May 24, 2012 on the last leg of our trip in the USA and I have to say, out of all the hotels we stayed in, it was the best! From the moment you check in it truly feels like home away from home. Our one bedroom suite was a great size after staying in small hotel rooms. The location of the hotel is fantastic, so close to everything.

The wonderful staff could not do enough for you and always showed interest in what we were doing. The room was always nice and clean and lovely to come back to at the end of our long days sightseeing in Hollywood. The complimentary continental breakfast consisting of cereals, toast, pastries, fruit, yoghurt, juices, tea and coffee was always appreciated.

The complimentary snacks and also the icy poles by the pool (which I have never encountered before in any hotel) were very much enjoyed. The pool was lovely and the hotel also supplied balls, etc for the kids to play with in the pool.

We had a wonderful time in Hollywood which was just made even better by this hotel. Thank you so much to all the staff for giving us a memorable stay, we will recommend your hotel to everyone and hope one day we get to come back and stay again!!!

I have been meaning to write this review for ages but am only just finding the time now (8 months after our stay!) I can't say enough about the Magic Castle. From the moment you walk in the door to the time you leave, you are made to feel so welcome. We stayed twice on an extended trip to the US (start and end) and both times were very happy.

The rooms are clean and well set out (it's not the Ritz so don't go in expecting marble bathrooms!) and the access to a kitchen is invaluable for those on a budget. We also loved the snacks and DVD's that were available for a night where we were too exhausted to venture out! We also spent a bit of time in the lovely pool.

As others have stated, the service is really what sets this place apart. On our last stay, we asked if we could store some luggage at the hotel so we only needed to take carry-on luggage for a Hawaiian jaunt. They couldn't have been more accommodating to our email request and Nick ensured our two large cases were kept safe and sound for the week we were in Hawaii.

Position to Hollywood Blvd a plus if you wish to spend time in that area. We had a car and parking was reasonably priced at $11 per day (from memory) and it was very easy to find our way to pretty much anywhere from the hotel.

All in all, a fantastic stay and I have been recommending this place to EVERYONE I know when they say they are heading to LA! Can't wait to come back ourselves!

We understand that all the rooms in the hotel are slowly being refurbished but our room was still to be done, hence why only 4 stars out of 5.
If we happen to pass by Los Angeles again, we would stay here.

Great location - short walk to the Walk of Fame, Madam Tussauds, Kodak Theatre etc. Maybe 5 minute walk to the train station.

The hotel offered free DVDs, chocolate bars, potato chips and soft drinks. It also has an onsite laundry, but bring your own laundry powder!

All in all a fabulous little hotel and I would definately recommend staying here.

My family stayed at this hotel between Christmas and New Year's, and I found the stay to be completely satisfactory.

My brother and I arrived about 2 a.m. after long flights from the midwest and a long ride in a thunderstorm from the Ontario CA airport. We were exhausted, and very chagrined to find that our sister had reserved only one room for four of us, expecting my brother and me to share a room with two other siblings, two to each bed. We went back to the desk, booked another room, and bought some food. We were stupid with fatigue and a little grumpy, but the staff made everything better, going out of their way to get us a room and meal as quickly as possible. They were utterly kind and gracious.

The room was nicely decorated, quite spacious, clean and comfortable. Good furnishings. The lobby was not huge but I enjoyed the contemporary decor very much -- very well done. The room rate was quite low due to a "lull" between December 25 and 30, so it was an excellent value.

We picked the hotel based on its location near Encino, where we were visiting family. The hotel is on Ventura Blvd, close to freeway exits/entrances (405 and 101), which made it easy to travel around. I would definitely stay here again.

Best 3.5 star hotel on Ventura Blvd in Sherman Oaks/Encino. Located off the 405 fwy at the Ventura Fwy this hotel offers a very comfortable stay for the business or casual traveler or someone wanting to stay on Ventura Blvd in "the Valley". The rooms are clean and the well appointed. Big screen TV but it needs TIVO, coffee maker that should have instant coffee VIA instant instead of cheap coffee drip maker and paper cups. The rooms are not energy efficient.. they should make it so that you have to use your room card to activate lights and have to take the card out when you leave room.. which then turns off the lights....the fridge overheats under the counter so make sure you crank it to high if you want your beer cold.

The gym is nice with a large TV and also individual TV on all machines. There is a large sun splashed deck and pool with a view south of Encino hills and the 405 Fwy. There is secure parking in the building and in/out access. The house staff is very nice,multi-lingual and the great service has the Marriott courtyard touch. The lobby is elegant and attractive, with a business center. The restaurant serves a nice breakfast for about $15. There is a lobby bar with big screen for sports but no happy hour and I would strongly recommend nice jazz music and even dancing in the lounge, because there is no nightlife or fun bars in the area. I saw Jim Simpson the famous sports announcer and his ABC crew. There in internet access. The paintings on the wll have nothing to do with LA life. The higher floors are accessed only with room card. The valley view rooms have a scenic view of the 405 Fwy interchange and in the morning before the smog you can see the entire valley to the mountain ranges.

There is really nothing for entertainment in the Encino wastelands.. it is Ventura Blvd urban sprawl if you know what I mean. There is a Whole Foods nearby and you can easily walk 2 blocks under the fwy to the Sherman Oaks Galleria for movies at the Arclight and great happy hour dining @ Cheesecake Factory (4-6), El Torito Grill (4-8) or PF Changs (3-6). I would say walk because you get charged $10 for each hour you go over your 3 hour movie validation..

East toward Sherman Oaks has many nice restaurants. Marmalade and Mel's diner are great for BK, Fatburger is the best burger in LA, there is an In-N-Out, Izakaya on Ventura Blvd for Sushi is A+. Blue Dog is an excellent sports bar and burger grill... on the side street behind the Whole Foods parking lot.

West on Ventura Blvd. is a Ralphs, high end Farfalla Italian restaurant and the only Starbucks in Encino. I did not like the homeless parking their shopping carts and smoking on the patio.. it messed up the aroma of my Kona Clover. If you have the guts and love seafood buffet.. Highly recommend Hokkaido seafood buffet...that is best buffet I have ever eaten at... just yummmy.

I visited family in Sherman Oaks and researched the area for a hotel with an ADA accessible room with roll in shower (wheel-chair) for other family members coming from NY. The hotel staff and concierge -Donald- were very patient with all my phone calls and questions. The ADA room has 2 queens and big bathroom with bars and the roll-in shower with fold down seat. My daughter and i has a 2 room suite, king bed with sofa bed. The king is very comfortable, sofa bed good enough for one adult or 2 kids. The suite has a seating area perfect for 6 adults and 2 babies visiting all day. Restaurant is decent but a bit limited. We requested --and got--a microwave. Coffeemaker in the room is like the Hamilton Beach personal pod brewer, i brought Senseo pods from home and they worked fine. Rooms have a balcony with interesting views of the mountains and freeways, doors are sealed for safety and noise reduction. Nice pool/spa area with fire pit and tables. On Ventura Blvd,.lots of stores and restaurants within walking distance, also a bus route. Parking is $15 day for guests, reasonable for this area.

We really liked this hotel--comfortable, clean, attractive, quiet. I would stay there again for sure.

The rooms are a little small but very clean and well appointed, with comfortable beds. Double glass doors kept out 95% of the racket from the Ventura Freeway screaming along eight stories below. The location is convenient to the Studio City-Universal Studios area, and the Westside is just a short hop back down the San Diego Freeway. There are plenty of eateries a 2-block walk away at the Galleria. Compared to similar properties in the general area, it's convenient and a good value.

Got a reasonable deal for this relatively new 5-star hotel just next to Times Square (on 44th, same block as the ABC studio). Were upgraded to a junior suite, perhaps because we were celebrating our honeymoon. The service was incredible. Friendly desk attendant, an actual hotel butler, art deco style out the wazoo.
Then the rooms. Wow. Somehow mixing ultra-modern features with luxury art deco style (high tech room controls on the phone), bathroom in sparkly maroon/brown granite and mirrors, TV in the wall, and the toilet from space with a warm seat and water jets (!!!). The upgraded room had a small "walk in" closet with safe and mini bar area, seating area, and desk that opened up to reveal a light and work area.

The location can't be beat for Times Square activity, without being right on the square (just half a block off).

Maybe the only downsides were that the room control touch screen on the phone did not respond well to touch, so it was often hard to change the lighting and drapery settings; also that the desk lamp that lights up when the lid is hinged open basically shined directly at eye level while working, so I had to drape a hand towel to serve as a visor when working on my laptop.

But overall, this was an amazing luxury boutique hotel, at a great location, with incredible service. I will return.

The front manager Brad, was incredibly helpful and accommodating in all areas. The staff in general made you feel like you were part of the family, and that they really wanted you to have whatever you needed. Had a fantastic facial in the spa and wonderful drinks at the bar.

The staff were faultless and their customer service spot on. We had a suite and it was lovely. The barthroom was the highlight, beautiful black marble and large rain shower. The bed was fantastically comfortable and we loved the ability to control the lights, temperature and curtains from the touchpad buy the bed.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to people wanting to have a quiet retreat in the heart of it all.

The Lamb's Club restaurant is excellent, and a small, well equipped fitness room, spa, indoor pool and hot tub round out your on-site options. Wi-Fi is on the house as it should be.

I prefer The Chatwal to the Four Seasons and the New York Palace, both top properties but each lacking the "boutique" charm and warmth that you find here. If you like high-class, high-tech, high-touch without the attitude, The Chatwal is a smart choice.

The hotel stuff makes you feel all the time like a real guest, they are always very friendly and are organizing everything you want to (cards for museum, Taxi, Restaurants ...). The Restaurant in the hotel is very good!
What else: gym in hotel is very good.
The location of The mark is very good, in a quiet little street between the Central Park and Madison Avenue, within walking distance to the hot-spots of the city (for example 20 min. to the Apple Cube) and only 2 minutes to Central Park!
I can recommend The Mark, on our next trip to NY we will stay again in this hotel.

We recently had a wonderful stay at The Mark. Aesthetically, the hotel is extremely elegant and sophisticated. The service was also fabulous. The staff was friendly and professional. They personalized our experience upon check in by making us smile in the elevator and while giving us the detailed tour of our room. The next morning, we ordered room service from The Mark Restaurant. Everything was perfect and it was delivered on time. The table that was brought in was set up right by one of our windows. We enjoyed the view while eating our delicious breakfast.
The Mark is a perfect alternative to any of the busier hotels in midtown. It's quiet and spacious, whereas many other New York City hotels fail to give guests that much needed break from the "hustle and bustle" The Mark did just that. Since our first trip, we've recommended the hotel to our close friends and they had a very similar pleasant experience. We can't wait to stay at The Mark Hotel again.

Glass ceiling in the restaurant makes breakfast very pleasant. Smallish in feel, in the New York way.

Located on a beautiful and quiet tree-lined street on the Upper East Sid, it is removed from the hustle and bustle of the city and within walking distance to some of the best shops and museums in NYC. The staff was very professional, friendly, and provided great hospitality. The room was clean, spacious, and the bathroom was large and included some great amenities. As an individual, who has stayed in many hotels all over the world, I would highly recommend The Mark to anyone visiting NYC!

My husband and I stayed at The Mark Hotel April 4th & 5th, 2012. It is located in the tony upper east side. Great designer shops in the area, good restaurants & delis. Our room was lovely & very roomy, and completely equipped with a great mini bar, in- room ice maker, cocktail glasses, drinking glasses, complimentaryl bottled water each evening. Turn- down service, complimentary robes & slippers, ample closet space, and a large bathroom with both tub & shower. Free WiFi, with a desk and a couple of comfy chairs in the room.

Situated in a quiet neighborhood ( Murray Hill), so sleep was peaceful, with no traffic or night noise. That, coupled with very a comfortable King bed, contributed greatly to our comfort and good night's sleep each night.

The hotel is relatively small and intimate. Their bar seemed to be very popular, but we did not go inside, as we aren't much for drinking. The concierge was very helpful and helped us to get the complimentary tickets to visit the World Trade Center Memorial. There is no cost, but you must have reservations, and you cannot get tickets on the site.

We really enjoyed our stay, and breakfast was included, so that represented a great value, and you could order odd a menu, so lots of selection, which we enjoyed. The service was top notch, and we would definitely say there again.

This is notmthemplace to,stay if you want to be within walking distance to Times Square,or mid-town, but we walked only 2 blocks to catch the subway, which was only 2 stops from 42nd street, and it was very cheap and easy.

The Mark has a couple of complimentary limos available to guests on a first-close basis, from 3PM leo 10:00PM, butmwemwere never able to,get one. The door man was very adept at getting us a taxi when we needed it, and all the employees were very friendly and helpful.

All in all, we really enjoyedmourmstay at The Mark, and would definitely go back!

I recently booked 3 nights accommodation at The Mark. I have been to NYC many, many times, normally staying downtown at the likes of: The Bowery; Soho Grand; Mercer etc. On this trip I decided it might be nice to do something totally different for the first few nights of my 12 day stay and book a good hotel uptown or on the Upper East side. After a fair amount of research on the similar hotels in this area, which hold a 5 star rating akin to The Mark, I decided to go ahead and book a Madison King Room. I have pretty high standards when it comes to hotels, travel a decent amount and I work in an artistic field so therefore apart from basic requirements deemed necessary in a hotel such as; good service, quiet rooms, bed quality, cleanliness etc., I am personally always very drawn to the small design details and dcor of a hotel, therefore based on what I saw from The Mark website and its status as one of NYC's nicest and most luxurious hotels, it looked beautiful to me and I very much looked forward to staying.

My husband and I flew in from the West Coast after flying from Sydney (20+ hours of travel) and arrived at The Mark at around 8.30pm on a very rainy Sunday night. The desk staff were nice enough, no major faults there, although honestly there is a somewhat snotty, pretentious feel about the place. It's fine if you like that sort of atmosphere (which I realise is all part of that 'UES NY' atmosphere and was half expecting it) but we found it a tad cold and insipid, it lacks warmth. You can still do 'refined UES' but be less wooden and stiff about it if that's the main agenda at your establishment due to the neighbourhood you are located in.. It all just comes across painfully stereotypical and rather boring.

We checked into our room and waited for about 20 minutes for our bags to be brought up. I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the room, the design was lovely, very stylish and it was spotless, as was the bathroom. Literally gleaming and it had a very cosy, glamorous and comfortable feel. The mini bar was good and wonderfully there was a large freezer section full of ice  so during your stay you have ice 'on-tap' so-to-speak ~ one feature I loved. We headed downstairs to meet a colleague for a drinks in the hotel bar then retired to the room and booked some room service food.

This is where it all when majorly downhill. Whilst I was waiting for the food I decided to take a deep bath, I was shattered after all the travel, the bath was great, great that is until I went to unplug it. After several attempts on both my husband's part and mine, we surmised it was totally broken and we'd have to call reception for them to organise a plumber. (BTW the plug in the sink was totally blocked too). A plumber was sent up at around 11.30pm who set about trying to fix the bath. At 12.45am he was still there and unable to fix the plug, so was shovelling bucket loads of my bath water into the shower, the room was a mess. Following this we got 40 minutes of incessant loud banging as he went at the plug with a crowbar (or what sounded like something similar). It was 15 mins into this stage that my husband went to the front desk to say we would need to be moved to another room as we were unable to get to bed for the previous almost 2 hours due to said hammering in bathroom at almost 2am.

Whilst my husband was at the front desk he received a very flippant and disinterested attitude from the receptionist. He asked that we were moved as it was getting onto 2am and we needed to get some sleep. He was told there were no rooms available other than one smaller than the one we had paid for and if we moved that's where we would be for our 3 days stay. They also told him the hotel was otherwise fully booked for the Monday and Tuesday  call me a cynic, but on a Monday and Tuesday night in early April in this area, I am instinctually feeling this was a lie. Also when I checked online in the room from my laptop, every form of room from a Madison King to their Penthouse was available to book (Why on earth don't hotels cop on to that fact guests can tell when they are lying about room availability by simply checking online ?!!). During my husband's time downstairs the plumber (a really nice guy BTW) came into my room, dripping in sweat from all his efforts saying it was totally unfixable and he wasn't sure how he could fix it the next day either.

I was pretty disgusted at this attitude from the front desk. Fair enough if we were in a 1 or 2 star hotel, but their entire attitude was snotty and cold and totally unacceptable for the level of hotel they claim to be. Had she said; "I am so sorry we are full tonight, would you mind staying in the room or the smaller one and out of courtesy we will move you to a better or same level room tomorrow?" that would have been utterly fine, also, we were very unimpressed that she never checked with the plumber after 15 or 20 mins to see how things were going as she would have been aware we were hanging around waiting for him to fix it.

We decided to stay the night and check out the following day as I'm not interested in forking out money to hotels who blatantly show they don't give a fiddlers about you unless you are paying for their Presidential suite. When my husband ventured down again to tell reception we would be leaving the following morning he was met with a stunned 'rabbit caught in headlights' stare from both female and male receptionists, who suddenly started pleading was there "Anything at all they could possibly do?", "Could we upgrade you to a better room tomorrow sir??!" What a joke, 30 minutes previous we were told there were "no other rooms available" other than a pokey lower level one. The following morning upon checking out we were asked how we enjoyed our stay? When we replied 'Very disappointed" yet again, another 'rabbit caught in headlights stare' from the morning staff who then mentioned "was there some issue with your bath plug, I see a brief note here, I am so sorry, next time please come and stay with us and I will ensure you are upgraded" The whole way they handled themselves was almost embarrassing esp. when they claim to be 5 star.

When we decided on the Sunday night at 2am to leave, I booked a room immediately at The Greenwich Hotel in TriBeCa and we moved there first thing Monday morning. Which, within second of walking into, was warm, inviting, friendly, cosy, incredibly decorated and totally welcoming, they have service and details down-pat. In hindsight I was actually totally delighted The Mark treated us the way they did as if not, I wouldn't have moved hotels and had a wonderful 2 night stay there will 100% return to The Greenwich on my next NYC trip. It is without a doubt the best hotel I have ever stayed at in New York.

On an end note, if you do decided to stay at The Mark a tip, book a room away from Madison Ave, during our one and only night stay, I must add the room was crazy noisy, at around 5.30 or 6am we were awoken by the irritating, high-pitched, repetitive beeping noise of a truck reversing, or maybe it was a bus as it happened about 6 or 7 times between this time and 8am aka zero sleep from 6am onwards. Fantastic when we only got to bed 4 hours earlier. In addition this was only made my annoying in addition to the loud humming all night long of the air conditioning unit which were found utterly impossible to turn off.

Really disappointing overall and a really awful way to start a long anticipated break away in NYC.

Thank you very much for sharing your well-considered and extremely thorough assessment of your recent stay with us at The Mark. On behalf of my entire team, allow me to personally extend my deepest apologies for the perceptions you have acquired about our property  first resulting from the plumbing malfunctions you experienced and then from the subsequent correspondences you received. It is unfortunate enough to hear that your bathtub was equipped with a faulty drainage system, and is even more distressing to hear that our follow-up communications with your husband only compounded your disappointment.

As humbling as it is to receive this criticism, your candid critique will serve our property team well, as we truly do continually look to find opportunities to improve our levels of service and attention to detail. I would also like to reassure you that, while your stay certainly did not met the highest level of service that I know our team is capable of, your experience is a rare one  one that I hope you will allow us to rectify and improve upon, provided you choose to give us another chance in the near future. If you have any additional comments or follow-up questions whatsoever, please absolutely do not hesitate to reach out to me personally via e-mail (Olivier.Lordonnois@themarkhotel.com) or by phone (212 744 4300). Once again, my sincerest apologies for the unfortunate series of events that occurred during your stay.

Trying very hard until I asked him to wait for the next elevator...

When we mentioned the unscheduled afternoon visit to the staff downstairs we got the Perfinctory "we a very sorry." response. At this level of hotel, one would have expected the staff to have more authority to "make things right." disappointing.

We loved the new bathrooms, the Sub Zero mini-bar systems, the technology "tablet" that operates just about everything (including the curtains) and the spaciousness of the rooms. The Mark has a long history of guests from "old wealth," but knows instinctively how to meet the needs of a cliental that includes a great deal of recent diversity. The wonderful bar and the Jean Georges restaurant add to a gracious and luxurious stay.

I travel to NYC for business and pleasure at least once or twice a year.
I have stayed in many different hotels in various locations throughout the city, mostly near mid-town where my business takes me. I can honestly say I have never felt more comfortable or more at home. Because it is a residence building and not an over-sized, transient hotel, it is quiet and comfortable and the location can't be beat. I agree with a previous reviewer, I did not want to leave and joked with the front desk I would call a real estate agent! Well, the Sherry does indeed have one, and her name is Theresa Nocerino. If you are in the market for a pied a terre, be sure to give her a call. Everyone at the hotel and in Cipriani's just raved about her. She made sure my every need was attended to, and the entire staff could not be more friendly. The elevator operators evoke an era gone by of service and style. If you want to feel refreshed and rested after a busy day in Manhattan, the Sherry is the place to stay. The only caveat is you may not want to leave your room, so don't overschedule yourself with appointments while visiting New York! 5 star, triple A+!!!

I go to NYC very often for shopping, to get my hair done, go to some dr. appts, these trips are usually solo. I also go with my husband and children during Christmas, and occasionally throughout the year. This is my favorite hotel on the East side, and I have stayed in many. The first time I stayed here I joked with Russell, the man at the front desk that they would probably have to remove me with police force because I loved it so much. One of the things that I find so amazing about the Sherry is that I find myself never asking for anything, because they have already thought of everything. The rooms are enormous, comfortable, the staff is attentive and lovely, I love the fact that beverages and wifi are included. The soaking tub and bathrooms are awesome. There is absolutely no street noise, which is kind of amazing given the location. The location could not be better, you are on the edge of central park, you can walk to any store you could ever want, as well as so many delicious restaurants nearby. There have been a few occasions where they have been booked up, but otherwise, I don't stay anywhere else, I simply don't want to.

My friends and I just spent an amazing weekend in NYC, based out of the Surrey. We all loved every aspect of the hotel - the decor was gorgeous without feeling stuffy, the service was genuinely incredible (loved our rooftop bartender and Peter especially!), and the location was perfect. Our room was very generously sized. It lacked a view, but we were forewarned by the front desk and chose it because it had 2 beds. The weekend was in celebration of our birthdays, and the hotel sent us a wonderful bottle of champagne - I cannot express how top-notch the service was! We especially loved the private rooftop terrace. It feels like the garden of a grand mansion, plus there are magnificent city views. Another plus was the location: easy to access UES shopping, Central Park and the 4, 5, 6 trains. I am already trying to plan a return visit ASAP!

Just checked out of the hotel this morning and back in DC. First of all let me start off by saying that this is a Great Place and would I stay hear again...you bet. The hotel staff was very friendly from the moment we walked in from the time we exited the taxi and checked out and back into the taxi. The Concierge (Andrew I think his name was) was extremely helpful and provided great input that helped our visit. The location was great just down the street from central park with a great price (comparatively speaking to other higher class hotels in the area that is). The room was very nice and roomy much bigger and nicer than I expected and the shower was awesome. The only reason this hotel didn't get a 5 was the poor extremely poor service at the bar. The bartender was not very friendly which was okay everybody has their bad days. However, the waitress was absolutely horrible when we sat at one of the bar tables. Not only was she not friendly not once did she come over to see if we needed anything. In fact, we had to pull other employees over to order our appetizers and our drinks throughout the night (not once did she help us literally). Considering their were only two of us and our bill was just shy of 200 bills this is unacceptable (especially considering we only ordered appetizers and martinis). We did go up to the roof top bar and met the waitress working up there and she was absolutely awesome (I don't remember her name but she lives in Brooklyn). As I stated before everything else was fantastic and we will stay their again and soon. However, if this happens again we will not stay there again because there are too many other higher end places that don't miss a beat in any area.

We were placed in an even better room that was so comfortable. Thanks Clifford! The hotel is very classy and all the staff are friendly and courteous. The location in the upper East Side between Madison and 5th Avenue is pleasant especially after spending time in more hectic neighbourhoods. It is literally located next to Central Park near a convenient entrance that leads through the park to Strawberry Fields. Our room was very spacious and luxurious in every way from the high quality bed linens to the marble bathroom. The hotel has a very pleasant rooftop patio. The hotel was very busy but never felt overwhelming. Overall, a great find and we would definitely stay here again.

Service is impeccable, with the concierge, front desk and bell staff always polite and responsive. I never had to follow-up or try to chase down a response to my request. Housekeeping came twice a day and did a wonderful job. Turn-down service was greatly appreciated with bottles of water and choclate-dipped madelines.

Stayed in a Grand Deluxe Room and loved it. It was a nice-sized corner room with beautiful furnishings, marble bathroom, and plenty of closet space. The very comfortable bed and awesome shower pressure are enough to make me return.

5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 4, 2012 NEW

This hotel was wonderful, Billy the doorman was a true delight everyday. Everyone at this hotel was great. Our room was lovely. I would suggest this hotel to anyone that plans to stay in New York near Time Square. This is my 4th trip to NYC and out of all the other hotels I have stayed this was the best. Again it was wonderful.

The room was quiet, exceptionally clean, bed was very comfortable and room was large enough for NYC with a great bathroom and shower area. The bath amenities were top of the line. We were on the seventh floor with a room that faced the back so no view, but no street noise, so it made for great sleeping. The maintaince of the property is excellent. No visible wear and tear on carpeting, furniture etc, throughout the property.
The entire staff, from front desk to bell staff (Rocky), to the maid service, to the concierge (Vanessa, who personally arranged a shipment of goods back to our home) were polite, friendly, professional and cared that or experinece was top rate. We had lunch at the restaraunt on the property and it was excellent as was the service.
Finally, the location is terrific. Easy walks to major attractions, shopping and to subways. Cabs plentiful and easy to get.

Myself and Fiance are just back from a five night stay at The Iroquois and we really loved everything this hotel had to offer.

Check in was quick and easy and all the Receptionist staff were very friendly. We were offered an upgrade to our room which we delinced as it was an extra $30 per night (we wanted to keep our money to spend) but it was nice to be offered.

After reading a lot of the reviews on here i was worried about the size of the room as people mentioned the rooms were very small. We didnt find this the case, the room was a good size. it fitted us and our suitcases with room to move about. The next time we stay at this hotel i'd like to see what a bigger room has to offer but in our opinion the room was a good size. We stayed in room 805 (superior queen) the only thing i could fault with this room was the view from the window which was just a brick wall. It meant we didnt get much day light coming in and werent to sure what kind of weather it was outside but you dont go to New York to stay in your hotel room so it really didnt matter to us that much. The bathroom was lovely and the molton brown toiletries a really nice touch. The room has a safe which is a must for us and a large closet with iron and ironing board it also has a Dvd player and the hotel offers complementary dvds.

We didnt get a chance to speak to the Concierge much as he was always busy with other guests but we did ask what bar would be best to go watch the Scotland vs Usa football match and he directed us to a great bar. All of the staff in the iroquois were so friendly and helpful and coming in to a nightly turn down service after a long day sightseeing was so nice.

We will without doubt be staying at The Iroquois again!!!

p.s the libary has free internet :)

One other downside - I charged drinks to the room - they were $20/each. They were basic martini's - fair warning. I had a lemon drop martini. I forget what the other person had. I believe this is overpriced - even for NYC. The location was terrific - close to Times Square, 6th Avenue and most of the mid town tourist sites. It was safe and comfortable - the people at the desk were very nice - so overall - nice.

The highlight though was the staff. From the servers in the lounge, to the desk clerks, bell staff and concierge, all made us feel we were the most important thing they needed to take care of that day. The advice for restaurants, transport and entertainment was first rate. And as has been mentioned in numerous posts the location is perfect. We are definitely looking forward to returning to NYC and The Iroquois.

My friends and I stayed in 2 connecting rooms at the New York Palace in May, 2012. I was worried about bedbugs before choosing a hotel in NYC since I know they are a problem in the city. Before booking I called the hotel and asked to speak to a manager. I asked if they have had any bed bug issues in their hotel. I was told they did not have any "confirmed cases". The hotel is in a great location so my friends and I decided to stay there, even though I was still wary of the bedbug issue. On the evening of our second night there, we saw a bug crawling on the wall. We happened to have a baggie so we put the bug in the baggie, and looked up a photo of bedbugs on our IPAD. It looked exactly like the photos of a bedbug. We called downstairs and someone came up and took the bug to be sent away for "confirmation". When I asked what else it could be they said a few other bug names, which I then looked up and they were all species of bedbugs. My friend and I were moved into another room in the Towers for the night. My other 2 friends in the adjoining room stayed since they had an early departure. My friends left early the next morning but discovered later in the day several bites which they believe to be bedbug bites. One of them tends to hug a pillow when sleeping and she got bites on her chest. I was moved to a very nice room in the Towers and we didn't have any other problems there.
The hotel is in a great location and has some nice features like an outdoor bar area ( crazy expensive but wonderful on a sunny evening). The rooms were nice. We did not see any bedbugs in the Towers, which is where I would suggest anyone stay who would like to stay at the New York Palace. The hotel never did "confirm" our room had bedbugs, even though we had the actual bedbug to prove it.

Guests who stay in the Towers have access to the Executive Lounge which provides a full american breakfast, light lunch and hors derves and cocktails in the evening. The best word to describe this hotel would be WOW!

Absolutely loved this experience....not just a hotel...from the moment we stepped out of the car upon arrival, we were made to feel special. Our room was in the towers, club level. Got a GREAT deal on Expedia. Needed a good sized room because we took our ten year old granddaughter. The roll away bed was in a corner of the room, always made up everyday. The bellmen, the maids, the servers in the club buffet area were so kind and efficient. This hotel is a destination in itself. Perfect location, walked a lock r two to subway stations, walked to plays, shopping etc. I can't wait to go back.

We got a free upgrade to a corner one bedroom suite. The room was a huge size and well equipped with an incredible bathroom. Loved the big dining table and the wifi was fast and efficient. However, there was building work going on nearby so it was very NOISY and we were woken up. Fortunately, the hotel gave us an extended late check-out as compensation for the disturbance.

Check-in was flawless. The lounge has iMacs to use which is great for airline check-in and printing boarding passes. The food in the lounge was amazing - wonderful breakfast and great afternoon snacks. Highly recommended. Great views over the Cathedral and towards Central Park. Loved the exclusivity of the Tower Club with its key entry system and separate elevators.

Location is ideal for Fifth Avenue and the main attractions. Bell services were extremely nice and helpful. Recommend this hotel!

We stayed in the club tower room at the New York Palace. The hotel has advantages and disadvantages. The positives are that the hotel is in a nice location, the rooms are spotless, the beds are very comfortable, the towels really good quality and the bathrooms cleaned really well. The club floor is very nice and provides outstanding meals. Concierge in the Tower section are extremely helpful and really nice people, they provide sound good advice.
The disadvantages with this hotel are: 1. The hot water goes cold often and remains cold for around 5 minutes. This means you have to get out of the shower. A problem when you have shampoo on your hair. This happened to us on 4 separate occasions. One time there wasn't any water at all. 2. The club floor staff do not clear the tables as efficiently as required and of concern they quite often do not wipe the tables, so you can have a clear table to sit at but it is dirty. 3. The club floor has ONE toaster for the entire club floor guests. The toaster is also extremely slow and when the toast finally pops up it isn't cooked anyway. The ONE toaster only does 2 slices at a time. The club floor staff have no attention to detail, and this is a real shame because the club floor produces great food and is set up on the 39th floor. 4. The door to the club floor kitchen makes the biggest squeeky noise that can be heard all over the club floor. Again, club floor staff have no attention to detail and could either a. put some oil on the hinge or b. keep it open. 5. The club floor can get quite busy, and they don't have enough tables and chairs to cater for a busy attendance. Add to this, they don't clear the tables as efficiently as they should, just compounds the problem. 6. Some staff at Reception at the Towers are in denial about the construction taking place and pretend that they don't know it goes on all night, 7 days a week. The construction even closed the road right outside the Hotel and really does impact on the entrance and the rooms on that side. We asked to be moved and we could even hear the noise in the night and we were not above it. 7. The hotel also does not have a good restaurant that provides decent genuine food. Instead they have the Guilt restaurant that only offers a set menu and the food is fiddly, poorly made and easily the worst restaurant we have ever been to, anywhere in the world. This is a real shame that the hotel allows this restaurant to be privately operated within the hotel. 8. The hotel has no pool. 9. The hotel has no jacuzzi or no spa

Overall, the problems could be resolved at the hotel and the fact that these problems go unresolved suggests that management aren't aware of what is going on. In about a years time, the construction will have been completed and that will resolve the noise problem. In the meantime, recommend that you only book if you have written confirmation that you can be guaranteed to have a room not on the side of the construction. In any case, we couldl still hear it, as we were just around the corner from the front of the hotel and heard the beeping and trucks all night. They even sounded a siren when the crane was operating during the night. There is a mature lady on the towers reception, who we recommend you avoid. She can be quite flippant with her remarks and not understanding that people are on a holiday that they have saved up for all year and been looking forward to. She also has no idea what time the club floor shuts either and send us up the first night and when we got there, we were told it was closed. It would be preferable for the hotel to be honest about the construction noise and the water problems they are having. No one likes to be misled.

Staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. I am a clean freak and tend to obsess over things BUT....even someone less germ-phobic than I would tell the management that the carpets in the two rooms we had were VERY soiled and unappealing. Fine hotels such as the Michelangelo would be wise to lose the carpeting and go to wood floors and area rugs. Initial cost of flooring may increase but payback would come quickly with easier and better daily maintenance.

While I am happy to see that others are upgraded and treated like royalty, I do not share the same type of service, maybe I should just reserve thru Expedia and hope that the staff thinks it is my first time at the hotel. This was my sixth or seventh stay and I was disappointed. The room was small and when i talked to June she said it was the same room type as in the last stay. Not sure how that could be when it had a couch and two chairs. Her explanation was that the rates go up every year and she could move me to another room with a charge of course. There was no turn down service on the second evening of my stay and I was told that they were understaffed. The quality of the toiletry items has declined from the last time. The complimentary coffee and Danish has been moved to the basement of the hotel in a very tiny windowless room. They need to just do away with this if they can't keep it in the elegant lobby bar. Where we're the doormen all weekend, oh wait that must have been them two doors down talking to their buddies at the adjoining building. Very disappointed with this stay, too many other boutique hotels to try.

Even the bellman were friendly and helpful. We were located only 2 blocks from Times Square and yet it was so quiet and relaxing. I have read so many times that New York hotels are shoebox small, but the Michelangelo room was very spacious, clean and very elegant. I can't imagine staying anywhere else.
Practically next door is the Cafe Duke, open 24 hours, for anything you would need at regular, rather than New York prices.
The free coffee, tea and pastries in the morning was just one more thing that put this hotel head and shoulders above the rest.
The best way to discernible the Michelangelo is that it really is an oasis in the middle of a bustling city.

The room looked into an adjacent building wall but was so quiet as a result. You'd never know you were in the centre of Manhatten. Great location just a few blocks to the subway, time square, rockerfeller centre and broadway. You can walk everywhere or just get on the subway. Very safe area to walk around. The hotel includes a quick cofee/tea and pastry to start your morning with. This is enough to get you going. Very helpfull staff and doorman. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here.

Since there were three of us and we had a roll-away bed, this was great; the extra bed went into the sitting room (thereby rendering it useless for sitting, but that was okay), and we had a powder room as well as a full bath, which helped a lot. The concierge arranged car services and restaurant meals for us, and the doormen got us taxis as needed. We were just a couple of short blocks from Times Square and the theater district, and there were plenty of restaurants nearby. That turned out to be a good thing; the breakfast we had at the hotel was over-priced and mediocre. That was our only complaint, however.

The real attraction for us was that we were able to walk to Central Park, Times Square, the Theater District, Rockefeller Center, shopping, etc. The hotel was very close to several eateries, including the famous Carnegie Deli! Subway stations are within easy walking distance as well. We felt that the hotel was reasonably priced, comfortable, and an excellent centralized location for getting to/from the attractions of NYC. We will definitely stay here again.

Our cases were moved to our new room while we were out without any fuss at all. The rooms are lovely and very clean, and the kitchen is a bonus, it includes a fridge/freezer, dishwasher and microwave. The lifts can be busy at breakfast but we really did not have to wait very long. Our room was situated right next to the lift and we were worried it would be noisy, but we had no problems.

The breakfast is good and includes cereal, eggs bacon etc and rolls and jam.

The staff are wonderful and very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. I will certainly recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again later in the year.

It's well located, being near to Penn Station, bus terminal, Times Square, etc. The room is a tight fit with a king bed, but you don't spend your time in the hotel when in New York. I only stayed one night but see the appeal of the little kitchen. Bathroom was well-stocked, bed comfy, room clean, wifi free and fast, staff very nice.

They were doing some work on the floor of the lobby while I was there that interrupted the elevator service to some degree, but I'm sure that's done now. My only complaint was the breakfast. Everyone in the hotel must have been eating at the same time - it was crowded, you had to go downstairs to sit and some of the food wasn't being restocked fast enough.

There is no room service if that is want you want, but you can have take out either in the lounge area or in your room if you want. The rooms might be thought of as a little drab, but with an excellent flat screen TV, microwave, dishwasher etc I don't think you should complain. Yes we were on the 27th floor and the lift could be a little slow at times, but not enough to complain about.

Breakfast is very good on a tuesday they have a wine and beer night which is well worth going to plus light snacks.

It is in a great location to see all and do all i would deffinetly recommend going on the subway this is the only way to travell to see new york.

PS make sure you pre book empire tickets on line and also 9/11 as you can get over charged if you pay on the day . its a great city and i would recommend it to any one of all ages.

have a great day

First time in NYC quite impressed that alot of the facilities were within walking distance of Times Square. Great transportation system for getting to & from in & around New York
As a group of girls travelling together & staying at your hotel we were quite pleased to see how clean, comfortable & convenient the rooms were especially to have everything supplied. Nice to have access to the amenities within your hotel free of charge.
Breakfast being offered and presented very nicely with a varity of food,well stocked at all times.
Cocktail being offered during the week says alot for the staff & management goes a long ways. Gives Guest time to get to know & speak to them one on one especially the Manger who went above & beyond(can,t remember his name starts with Ki sorry)who offered places to eat, see, do etc. When he learned of one of the girls celebrating her 60th. birthday he made sure her day was special by surprising her with a bottle of champagne on ice in her room when she arrived back to hotel.
Very considerate.
Staff were very friendly & enjoyed how they would mingle with the guest as they were coming & going from the hotel.
Most impressed to see good communication from Mangement, Staff & Guest. Congratulations.
Your ratings should be at least 4-41/2 Star

We stayed at this hotel from May 22-25. It was three of us. My wife, six year old son, and myself. We chose this hotel because it was so close to everything and because of the reviews.....we were not disappointed in the least. The hotel was beautiful and the rooms were spacious and clean. The full size fridge was a plus. We didnt use the stove though. Times Square is literally right around the corner. We walked just about everywhere and we never felt unsafe. We did learn something that is not mentioned in any of the reviews however. We flew into Laguardia and all yellow cabs charge a flat rate of $45 to take you to Manhattan but we found a car service that took us to and from the airport for much cheaper. There is a car service called carmel and they were great and very quick. their number is so easy to remember i will never forget it...212+666+6666. if you have a smart phone you can download an app called cab 4 me and it is really great, but i digress
whenever we needed fresh towels, they were brought right up. it was very quiet and we were only a few feet away from the elevators. we never had a problem with the elevators, the longest we waited was maybe 60 seconds. breakfast was different everyday. If you get up early there arent alot of people there but around 7 oclock it fills up pretty quickly. the free happy hour they have from 5-7 was quite nice, the only real down side to this hotel is the fact that they dont have a tub. After walking all over new york it would be nice to soak in a hot bubble bath to relax your feet but the shower is nice.
when we return to new york this is the hotel of our choice. the view from our room was simply amazing. it was a view of times square.

There was plenty of space and the bathroom was huge. I have heard horror stories about NYC hotels being so tiny you can barely open the door. Not so at Eventi, spacious, clean and nicely decorated. And not only was the room fantastic, but the staff were so helpful. I came in on a red eye and had an event at 2pm that day. I called the front desk twice to see if a room was available yet, explaining I had to get ready for my event. The second time I called, they remembered me and because I was a rewards member and they knew I had an event they upgraded me to a room that was available now. Much appreciated. They also had a happy hour from 5-6 with wine and sangria, plus the water always had really refreshing iced tea or infused water. Whatever it was, it was really good.

They upgraded us to a suite on the 23rd floor, which was ready when we arrived at 11am. Then when we got back from sightseeing, there was a bottle of champagne and box of truffles with a note from Marco, the concierge. The staff is top notch--always friendly and helpful. Both times we've stayed here, the rooms have been quiet with comfy beds, which helps you to recover from the hustle and bustle of the city. We love the location--just one subway stop from Times Square, and plenty of subway lines to choose from. Eventi is definitely our first choice for future trips.

We visit a couple times a year and for the last year or so, have stayed exclusively at this hotel, changing from several years worth of stays at their sister hotel, 70 Park. I believe this is our 5th visit to the hotel. We were very grateful to be checked-in a bit early so we could make our standing lunch reservations downtown - that was a huge bonus since we usually have our puppy in tow and we are always fretting abuot what time we will actually be able to get into the room. This time, we upgraded to a suite - and the room did not disappoint. It was spacious (especially by NYC standards), with hard woods, a separate sitting room, and marble tiled bathroom. The only downside, we learned after checking in, is that all suites face west (not the most appetizing view) instead of a city view. So, you'll have to pick your poison - space or view. But, having stayed on the other side, the rooms there are also rather large, so either way you are safe. We love the lobby staff, from the doormen who always remember us (probably because we have a very cute, by active, pomeranian in tow), the manager, Gabriella, helped us through a few bumps that were specific to our pooch, and the bellman staff who were always accommodating. There was a large wedding taking up the outside 5th floor balcony on one of our nights there, so wine was served in the lobby, which was fine since it was a bazillion degrees outside. And, I enjoyed the fashion show as the gorgeously outfitted guests began arriving. We had a good talk with the 2nd floor restaurant staff who acclimated us to the new set-up there. They have lovely outdoor seating which will be nice in cooler weather. A bit disappointed that we couldn't bring Simba out on the balcony on the bar side - we had high hopes for a cocktail out there on one of our days, but we understood their policy. Everyone is accommodating and helpful and warm. You will love the location - traffic faces uptown on a one way street, which makes taking buses from downtown a breeze. A walk crosstown takes just 10 minutes. The area itself is rather sparse, but you can walk up to shopping areas north of the hotel, if that's your thing. We pretty much stay put downtown for some of our favorite restaurants, so we tend to walk over to 5th Ave and take a downtown bus straight down (easy-peasy.) We also usually arrive by train at Penn, after parking our car at Secaucus Junction where parking is much cheaper. It is just one short stop from Secaucus to Penn Station and a simple block walk over to the hotel. We figure what we save in parking and in cab fares, we can spend elsewhere (like upgrading to a suite!) We will return in September for yet another visit, if not sooner. We look forward to (hopefully) cooler weather and a terrific stay.

Cannot say enough good things about the Eventi in NYC. Close to the iconic Flat Iron building, and walking distance to the famed Macy's and Times Square. Wonderful mid-town location.

The property itself is deceptive from the outside. The outside appears to be your standard NYC hotel. However, once you step inside you know this is a unique property. The lobby has comfortable chairs and sofas, and when we arrived there was a fire going in the fireplace. The lobby offers gourmet tea and coffee each morning, and water with fresh fruit is present in the afternoon and evenings. The hotel hosts a guest wine reception night on the roof top (which moves to the lobby in the event it rains).

The rooms are beautiful, extremely clean, and the beds are amazing and so comfortable! Loved that the beds were queen size, and not doubles or the dreaded NYC twin. My friend loved the pillows so much that she ordered one online when we returned home! The best thing to note about this hotel is that it is quiet!! We were the first room directly off the elevator and never once heard elevator traffic or guest noise. We also never heard street noise. The only one thing I would change would be to add a bath tub, but that would be it.

The best part of this property for us was the front desk staff, especially the night staff. Everyone was genuinely kind and extremely friendly. It was nice to be welcomed late each evening by the night crew.

Hands down, this is a great property and I'll be back!

The actual service from the staff seems much to be desired. I only spent a night there and was worried about catching a flight very early the next morning. I approached the front desk and ask the man there to organise a taxi for me at 4am - he laughed and said that there are always taxis outside so I don't need to worry. Being a foreigner and worried about missing my international flight I expressed concern and he said he would make sure that one was there for me then so I didn't need to worry - I was quiet skeptical that he would actually do this because of his tone and he seemed pretty tired of me bugging him about this taxi issue.

The following morning at 3:50 I was told that there was no sign or note left by the guy at the front desk to organise a taxi for me and I was fetched at 4:15.

Experience at this hotel was average compared to the 3 boutique hotels i stayed in before this. Not worth the money for such an average experience.

Just come back from an amazing stay in NYC at the Eventi. I really wanted to give this hotel a 5 star review as up until the final day they had done no wrong. However when we went to check out, we had been charged for items from the mini bar and room service which we hadn't ordered or take. When we told the member of staff this, he said that he would have to 'investigate' and if we could wait. We sat for over 20 mins before he came over and said that although they had the charges on their system they didn't have a receipt for the room service. At this point I questioned that perhaps the room service had accidentally been charged to the wrong number. This was met with a frosty reply that it was on the system. Essentially implying that we were lying about it. I said that what was concerning me was that someone was using our name, or if not ordering to our room without us being there. The member of staff just said 'well like I said there's no receipt so we'll just take it off'. Now if I had ordered it, I wasn't going to pretend I hadn't and try and get out of paying. I just incensed me that we were made to feel accused and treated like we were trying to get away with something that was at the end of the day the hotels error. Shame as everything up to that point had been great.

My wife and I stayed 4 nights mid-May and it was great. We arrived by train from Penn and found easily our way to the hotel within 15min.
We did not take the breakfast, as there was plenty of choice outside the hotel.
Nice steak restaurant (Brendan's), Subway, 2 Irish pubs and 2 Korean restaurants are on the same street with the hotel (2 min walk max.).
Also, Starbucks just across the hotel, past the subway station. And supermarket and souvenirs, etc. Everything is very close if you stay at this hotel.
The service at the reception and concierge is thoughtful and pleasant, cleaning was impeccable.
Room could be a little bigger (we had standard city view room on 30th floor, facing the Empire State Building), but this is NY... LAN/Wifi Internet in room. Safe also. Although right across 2 elevators, we could not hear anything in the room - very nice surprise.
Cannot say much about the rest, as we stayed most of the time out of the hotel.
Took the subway to Brooklyn, then walked the Brooklyn Bridge back and entered the Financial District, going further to Battery Park to take the ferry for the Statue. This was roughly a 5 hour tour, since we skipped Ellis Island.
Walking from the hotel in the evening is very easy to get to most theaters with Broadway shows, Times Square and up to the lower edge of Central Park - less than 1h easy walk to the park.
One can book from the hotel cruises around the city, on boat or bus, but we did not, as we preferred to walk every street.
Beware, if it rains or it is foggy, you will not be able to see the city panorama if you climb the Rockefeller or the Empire. Looking out from the hotel window gives you already a good sense of how clear the sky actually is....
We had a great time and would recommend this hotel for any NY visit, as its location is perfect.

What can I say that hasn't been said by all the positive reviewers here.
Before we even arrived, Beanca emailed me to make sure things are ok and that she'd have something special for my wife for her birthday later in the week. Sure enough we had a high floor room with a great view of the Empire State Building. For her birthday Beanca sent up a birthday cake. I thought the great room was good enough but Beanca sent my wife a birthday cake as well. What a great gesture! I can't remember the name of the girl who checked us in. She talked to my little girl when we checked in. During our stay whenever she saw us she'd wave at my little one which made her feel very special. Thank you so much for that.

The room was great. I've been in smaller rooms in NYC so i can't complain about the size of the room because I thought it was fairly large. The fridge was great as we could buy milk from the pharmacy a few steps away from the hotel and the little one would have something to drink before going to sleep. The shower. It was great! I love it that it actually has a good flow of water pressure. After a long day of walking through the hot and humid weather, coming back for a relaxing shower was very soothing.

Otherwise. Great hotel. Clean. Friendly staff. There was some noise from the street but the room was generally quiet. This will be our hotel of choice when we visit NYC from now on.

The Hilton Garden Inn on West 35th Street is a clean, well-staffed, and centrally located hotel. Less than a block from Macy's, a block from the Empire State Building, a few minutes to Times Square, and convenient to the subway system. One can easily walk to either Penn Station or Grand Central in about 10 minutes. If you drive, they have an arrangement with a parking garage on 26th street for discounted pricing. (Of course in NYC, "discounted parking" is relative...).

We had two rooms during the stay for four guests. Our rooms faced 35th Street and were on the 12th floor. Street noise was not an issue. The rooms were clean and comfortable, although not as large as one might find at Hilton Garden Inns in other locations. Space is a commodity in the City and visitors will likely spend little time in the rooms outside of sleep, shower, and sorting out plans for the day/night. The A/C worked well and kept the rooms comfortable (allowing to keep the windows closed, thus reducing any street noises issues).

The hotel is serviced by three elevators. During our two night stay, it seemed as if one elevator was out of service at some point or another. This slowed getting to and from rooms a bit, but was not overly intrusive. Peak times in the morning were a bit slowed by only two elevators, but nothing to stress over.

The lobby has a small bar/lounge area to get a drink. A nice spot to relax and decide "what next". There is a hotel restaurant, but we did not take advantage of it. With so many food options in the city, I find it difficult to "eat in" when so much awaits outside.

Pricing is very competitive for NYC. It was Memorial Day weekend, so in an off-peak weekend, prices could be better.

If returning to NYC for a stay, we would very much consider this location again.

We shared a king bed because there were no rooms avaliable with two beds. One side of the adjustable air bed deflated in a matter of minutes and would not hold air. I was told this is extremely rare, but I have been told that before at other HGI's (I'm an HHonors gold member). Maybe I'm just unlucky, but this has happened to me on at least two other occasions (deflating bed). When these beds work properly, they are excellent, but when they don't work, they are horrible. I have back issues and like these beds when they work, but when they don't, it's very bad news if you have back issues.

Without a doubt, this is one of the top 2 airport hotels at LAX. I stayed here maybe around 20 times back in the 1990s (it was still fairly new then) and this was my first visit in over a decade (April 2012). After reading some of the horrible reviews online, I decided to take a chance since the Hilton and Westin at LAX have held up really well over the years.

Check In was amazingly friendly. The Black Lady at the front desk (I didnt get her name) was so wonderful and really went out of her way to place me in a wonderful room on the 9th floor. We had a lovely chat about the hotel back in the 90s, and I was able to share a few stories. She really made the difference in kick starting a lovely stay.

I CANNOT SAY THIS ENOUGH....First impressions at Check In set the stage for the stay. Period!

The room was very modern with beautiful furnishings throughout. Modern fittings in the bathroom, large flat screen in the room, very comfy chairs and a super comfy, albeit firm-ish bed. Housekeeping staff were super polite! The room felt and looked super clean if you know what I mean!

There is a nice gym on the 2nd floor, pool and.....sauna (rare in airport hotels).

The hotel lived up to my expectations as in the older days, and I HIGHLY recommend everyone to pick this hotel. I only stayed here for one night this time, but the hotel would work for anyone who needs a few nights. Its a very classy hotel up there with the LAX Hilton, better than the Westin LAX. Anyone looking for an airport first class plus hotel would not be disappointed by either of the three.

The Renaissance is the only 4 star hotel at LAX (for you priceline/hotwire bidders ;)

Burger King is across the road (if thats your thing) otherwise In & Out is a quick 3 min drive with other food places and a Ralphs supermarket and Trader Joes market (TJ is the place that foreigners will love) near by. The airport is less than 5 mins on their bus (which I did not use this time)

If you like to watch airplanes land...the final approach to the runway is within excellent viewing range (hotel has triple framed windows, so noise is hardly an issue).

All the car rental places are across the street or nearby, with Avis and Budget within a 2-5 min walk.

Not one issue with this hotel!

'LAX Renaissance'
3 of 5 stars Reviewed June 3, 2012 NEW

I bid for 4 star LAX on Priceline and got this hotel for $70. The lobby was nice
and cool design and the front desk staff were very friendly. I think my room was a lock-off room from a suite. It was small with a strange configuration. The furnishings looked dated and the upholstered chair had a big stain on the seat cushion. The TV sat on a dresser at an angle from the bed, not directly in front.
The room had a small desk and a refrigerator but no mini bar the window was small
with a view of a parking lot. The bed was nice and comfy. There is valet and self parking. Self park is easy and the garage is adjacent to the hotel by elevator. I don't remember the self park fee but I think it was $25.
The hotel is immediately outside LAX and really close to rental car returns.
I didn't try the hotel restaurant nor did I use room service. There are several
fast food places within a few blocks McDonald's, Carl Jr's.
It's a very convenient place to stay if you have an early flight.

The second visit we asked to upgrade to a suite. We paid a small price and also received access to the lounge on the club floor with free breakfast. This room was well appointed and although we only had a king bed and a sofa bed, it was worth the price. There was an appropriate level of staffing on the second visit, so that when someone arrived to check in another receptionist appeared at the front desk. The week before there was a line for check-in. The bar and lounge area also had pleny of help, compared to the previous week. Now I would stay at this hotel again, knowing what I know about the different room accomodations.

I have been very happy with my stays here of the last couple of years. I travel to LA often for business and the Renaissance has become my top choice. I Have to say the new management gets the 5. If I graded last year it would have been a 4. What impressed me most was that the staff recognized me at my second visit and greeted me like an old friend, unlike where I had been staying previously for almost two years of business trips. I have always found the staff willing to assist, whether it was a room issue or recommending a local restraurant. The restraurant in the hotel has good food, but the menu is not to my taste. The Fitness room seems to always be clean, functional and with enough equipment to not be crowded. With two years of experience here, I have had some issues with rooms, that have been handled very promptly and only once have I ever had to make a second call on the issue. All rooms have a mini-fridge which is now a necessity to me as a travelling diabetic. Internet service was not very stable at times last year, but that seems have been worked out. Airport transport has been much better since they changed the routing, usually taking less than 20 minutes from getting to the lobby to airline dropoff. Sometimes the busses get out of sync and it will take 30 minutes from lobby to dropoff. There is a monitor showing the bus locations just across from the valet parking stand. If in a hurry it has only been $10-12 (including tip) to take a cab.

I would say, save yourself the overnight parking charge as you can leave the car in one of the side streets next to the hotel (not even 50 meters away from the main entrance).

We had a room on the 5th floor facing the airport. You can't really hear anything so noise is not an issue.

All in all, good place to stay.

I had a bit of drama trying to get a room with two beds and manager had to intervene to solve my problem. Apparently reservations are only a 'request' and don't really constitute a "reservation". This shows poor hotel management and puts unnecessary stress on guests during check-in process. If I book a room with two beds, I expect to get a room with two beds! Period!

The rooms are clean with refreshed carpet, furniture and flat panel TV with plenty of towels and amenities. My only issue was with the bed. It seems like an old mattress (a little wobbly) with not much support and padding. It's a shame. If you change the mattress with a good quality support, it would be a very comfortable hotel.

Both valet parking and self-parking are outrageously expensive. If the room is ~$100 per night, does it make sense to charge 30% of the daily room rate for valet parking and 15% for Internet access?

This Marriott was a bit of a let down from other Renaissance properties we've stayed in.
Kind of hard to pinpoint why...just kind of blah, nothing special about the rooms.
They almost seemed more Holiday-Inn-ish (which doesn't neccesarily mean bad, just not what you'd expect from Marriott).
The decor was a mish-mash of furniture and everything seemed like it was poor quality furniture, lamps, art on the walls, etc.
The bathroom also wasn't up to par...very basic bathtub/shower, but clean.
Hard to tell this from the photos and again, it wasn't horrible, just disappointing and not what we've seen at other locations.
This may be good for an airport stopover, but we intended it as a base to spend 4 nights in L.A. to sightsee because we got a good AAA rate of $94/nt.
Not a good location for this...guess we should've known better. Too far from all the tourist stuff (Hollywood, Beverly Hills, etc) and of course traffic is horrible (duh!)
We reserved all 4 nights and left after 1 after getting a good deal on Hotwire in West Hollywood at the Hotel Palomar (LOVED that place...I've also posted a review for that one).
I'm assuming it's convenient from LAX (we did NOT fly into or out of here so can't comment on that), but if all you want is close to the airport, clean and you get a good deal, go for it.
But if you are expecting a 4 star room you may be let down as we were.

The rooms are immaculate and really comfortable but all very private, with no busy foyer to have to negotiate. The en-suites are a good size, the rooms are welcoming and very comfortable.It's small scale and it's very personal. The location is great for Santa Monica, Brentwood, Sunset, Hollywood and the freeways. The staff were just wonderful and the whole place is very relaxing and immaculate. Each member of staff - it has only one or two on at a time - was wonderful and it has a lovely cosy, welcoming feel. Brentwood village is a ten minute walk and has wonderful restaurants and a great village feel - make sure to visit Brentwood village mart on Barrington. Any issues? Only one. We stayed in room 460 which has a wonderful private patio area and is larger than the other rooms, but the hotels boiler is located right behind the back wall and you can hear it operating at night. It's quite loud but it's not such a big deal after a night or two. I'm sure the folks at the front desk have offered the explanation many times before. I'd certainly go back and to the same room. A great stay.

Stayed at the Brentwood for four nights while visiting friends and sightseeing in LA. For the price, it is hard to imagine a better choice in LA. The room and bathroom were small but clean, the bed, linens, TV, and toiletries were top quality, and the continental breakfast, fresh fruit and tea available all day, and cookies and milk in the evenings were an appreciated touch, especially if you've had to sit in LA traffic! Evan at the reception was a pleasure throughout our stay. The shopping areas of Brentwood are close enough to walk, though we drove since we had a car.

The hotel's location is particularly good if you're interested in spending time in Malibu, Santa Monica, or Venice, or visiting the Getty. The trip to Hollywood or Los Veliz is quite a bit longer, but that's because LA is a big city. There was a lot of traffic on Sunset outside the hotel, but I am not sure there's anything to be done about that; it's LA after all and considerably cheaper than a more secluded place like the Beverly Hills Hotel, a little further east on Sunset!

We booked a queen room, but if we did it again we'd probably book a king room for a couple. Queen seemed perfect for one person, but it was a little tight for two, as we both had big bags (we were in the middle of a two-week trip).

Very friendly staff. My only gripe would be that its right next to an intersection and the traffic was quite heavy and a bit noisy, as a result I found myself waking earlier that anticipated each morning. Still, I'd very happily stay here again.

Had to do some paperwork in conjunction with work and the reception staff was very helpful in regards to printing and scanning the documents.
Room was clean and comfy! Complementary wireless internet is also available which was nice.
There is a continental breakfast, but we did not try this. The cookies in the evening was a nice touch!

If traveling by car be aware of traffic in LA. It is congested almost all day long.

The grounds are small (one of the reasons I choose it) and the rooms are a little small too, but the cleanliness and service made up for that. Having been in the hotel business, I know what good service is...that personal touch is what brings customers back time and time again. Special kudos to Britain who was so cheerful and helpful, even at 10:00 at night. He is certainly an asset! If you are tired of the typical overpriced, large, impersonal hotels in the L.A. area, The Brentwood Inn is the place for you!

Having read the reviews and stayed recently at this hotel. it is not surprising why people love the Brentwood Inn. This hotel probably possesses the friendliest and most helpful staff in Los Angeles (Naz, Britain and Evan - sorry if I've misspelt your names). Staff at this hotel are so keen to help visitors and make their stay as enjoyable as possible. The hotel is located in a great neighbourhood and there is a lovely breakfast in the morning. Wifi access in the hotel is great too and we benefited greatly from the free parking. Having spent a long time looking for hotels in Los Angeles (and being astounded at the high prices), we're glad that we stayed at the Brentwood Inn.

After spending ages searching for somewhere to stay in LA (with parking), I finally came across the Brentwood Inn and chose it because of the good reviews it had. I wasn't disappointed. We received such a warm welcome when we arrived and all the reception staff were very friendly and helpful and told us places to visit etc. They have different types of teas and cookies in the reception that you can help yourself to in the afternoon and evening, and the breakfast (included in the price) was very nice - fruit, cereals, yoghurt and pastries etc, and you can sit in the little courtyard and eat it.

One of the big benefits was the free parking and you can park right outside your room. The rooms have been very nicely renovated and are very comfortable and spotlessly clean.

It's located in Brentwood which is a nice suburb. You really need a car if you're staying here. It's well located for driving out to the coast, eg Malibu, Santa Monica, Venice Beach etc, and also for driving into Hollywood, Beverly Hills and downtown.

We really loved this hotel and would stay there again if we go back to LA.

The staff here certainly know how to look after their guests. Every member of staff made our visit for our wedding anniversary extra special. We were upgraded on arrival and were given a complimentary bottle of prosecco which we enjoyed on the splendid rooftop bar.Our room was a decent size for New York with a wonderfully comfortable bed and a very trendy shower .The location on West 47th Street literally just off Times Square was excellent. It was hard to believe the tranquillity of the hotel in comparison to the hustle and bustle of Times Square.A simple breakfast was included in the rate which more than filled you up for the day ahead. Information and advice was given readily and staff always took the trouble to ask you about your day- we particularly enjoyed the attention we got from many of the staff after we attended the Mets game where Johan Santana achieved cult status by achieving a 'no -hitter' in the game against St Louis Cardinals. As a brit who didn't know a great deal about baseball before I quickly realised the historical significance of the event as it was plastered over news bulletins in papers and on TV. I could write so much more about the Sanctuary Hotel and would recommend it to anyone. Special thanks to Julio for his advice, wit and general hospitality.A wonderful hotel- keep up the excellent work!!!

The staff was exceptional at making us feel like VIPs. They were not in your face but they were sincere, professional, helpful, and welcoming. I loved everything about this hotel. The atmosphere was swanky and different, modern yet elegant. It was so nice not to stay in a cookie cutter hotel designed for business travelers or the past century. Check out Cloud 9, the rooftop lounge, it's a MUST! You can see Times Square from there! (Perfect for an after theater cocktail!) The attention to even the tiniest detail like the room signs made this hotel an experience. I will be staying here again!

Before selecting Sanctuary, read the reviews here. It is not a $95/night Hampton Inn along the interstate with large rooms and a big free breakfast. It is in the heart of New York City where space is at a premium and most hotel rooms are small and expensive...just like Sanctuary. Other hotels charge outrageous fees for internet access and the most basic continental breakfast. Sanctuary has free Internet and a perfectly good light continental breakfast included in the cost of the room. If you want a full breakfast, you can leave the hotel and pay for ham, eggs and hash browns within a block. And if you need surgical level lighting to find your way down the hall, look elsewhere. Sanctuary is all about a great, quiet location a block from Times Square and a staff that is fully committed to a level of service that is hard to find anywhere. We were part of two couples who just spent four nights there in King Deluxe rooms which provided all the room we needed. We couldn't believe the level of attention we received from the staff. They spent all the time we needed to give us information about getting around, making recommendations and booking reservations for us. We were always greeted warmly coming and going. But if you like to be left alone and ignored, Sanctuary is also not for you. For us it was perfect.

I read many reviews before my trip to NYC and I picked the Casablanca for our first 4 nights, then we had to go to Washington DC for a few days and I chose the Sanctuary for our last 2 nights in NYC.
I picked it because it was close to TS, breakfast was included and the reviews were great.
The staff are really nice and attentive but I think we just were not lucky. We got there and were greeted very nicely and shown to our room in no time. The room was tiny, only space for one night table and the shower was right next to the bed, so very disappointing!!! We waited for our luggage for a while and decided to go for a walk because it never got to our room, on our way out, my sister noticed one of her bags was by the front desk, strange!!! so we asked about our bags. There had been a sort of misunderstanding and they had stored them. No problem , they sent them to our room right after. Now our room was cramped!!! tiny and with 4 big bags plus 2 pieces of hand luggage. !!!!
The bed was nice and soft and the place was quiet.
We decided to look at the bright side. We were in NY and we had only 2 days left so we tried to make the most of them.
The hotel was really dark, it looked like a night club to me, the sanctuary part was OK I mean the front desk and the aisle on the way to the elevator, but the decor at the bar and coffee place wasn't really related to anything like a sanctuary.
Breakfast was OK, orange juice, coffee and bagels, some other pastries, we usually have a light breakfast so it was Ok for us.
The people at the front desk were very attentive, they printed our check in vouchers and were always willing to offer help with directions etc.
When we booked the room we were offered a bottle of prosecco and we asked for it on our last evening. I had to ask for it 3 different times and mention their STAR policy to finally get it. We had it at the lounge which was nice, because our room was so little.
I really hate to say this because the staff are so very nice and I understand the good reviews, but if I had known the size of the rooms and the night club look I wouldn't have booked it.

Thank you for taking the time to post a review about your visit to the Sanctuary Hotel

I'd like to apologize that your experience at our unique hotel was not what you expected.. We have a very distinctive contemporary style . As you see from most of our reviews, our guests appreciate a cozy, warm, and inviting atmosphere that we strive to create. We make every effort to present our guests with a discrete retreat away from the hustle and bustle of the city, creating a "home away from home" feel, with a touch of glamour. The goal with the design is to create a serene and tranquil environment that would be representative of the Sanctuary Hotel name (not to mention the genuine and attentive services that our staff provides).

Although some of our rooms are not considered large, many would agree that it is common to New York standards. I would like to suggest you try our deluxe rooms, which have additional space for added comfort and upgraded amenities. I believe that it would definitely be a better fit for your needs. Additionally, we always ensure that we are competitively priced and offer additional value that most hotels charge for. We offer complimentary wifi, breakfast and gym passes to "Equinox". Along with our well known service, we believe that we offer a great value.

My only wish is that you would have informed us about your unhappiness with the room size, and given us an opportunity to provide you with additional room options. Here are the Sanctuary, our team is always here to ensure guest satisfaction.

I would love for you to give us another opportunity in the near future, so that I may personally ensure that you have a comfortable and enjoyable visit.

What can you say, from the moment you arrive, until you have to leave, you are greeted by staff who are only too willing to help. The service is superb and the staff are what makes the Sanctuary Hotel special. You are made to feel welcome your entire stay unlike the bigger hotels.

Nothing is too much trouble, they are friendly, courteous and professional. After a long day of sight seeing, shopping, entertaining or dining, a nice touch is the welcome you get each time you come back, no matter the time.

The rooms are beautifully decorated, the bed is super comfy and the shower wonderful with its big shower head. No problems with the size of the room. Not sure how much more room the others need when that say they are too small (stayed in smaller when I was in Hong Kong).

The decor of the hotel is luxurious and complements the theme the hotel has. Some may say it's a bit dark but it makes the atmosphere very relaxing and welcoming unlike some of the big name hotels which seem clinical and lack warmth. It's more like coming back home than a hotel.

And as they say, location, location. Any closer to Times Square and it would be their front door. It is less than a minutes walk away. Plenty of other sights are a short walkaway and those that are not you walk past the a subway station when walking to Times Square.

If your not sure, as the Sanctuary is not one of those name brand hotels, don't worry you will enjoy your stay here, I did.

The staff is friendly and helpful, they made our hotel stay a breeze.
Breakfast was good, I wish they had more cereal options, but the coffee made up for it.
Also, the location is a plus, it's literally a block away from Times Square.

The service was superb, from the staff who helped me with my luggage to the very friendly barmen.

On arrival I was asked if I knew how to get taxis, how much to tip and general getting around the city which really helped since it was my first time to NYC.

The rooms were well decorated, bed very comfortable and the shower was divine (especially after travelling for 20hrs!)

In the evening, one of the 'experience managers' called Jacob Schwartz totally took care of my first night out and it was truly memorable. From the exquisite vehgetarian restaurant to a New York hot spot, my first night in this vibrant city was incredible! A great thanks to him for making my stay with you guys unexpected but exceptional.

I look forward to coming back to stay with you guys. Keep up the excellent service and unique oferrings.

'A luxurious, welcoming retreat in the heart of Midtown Manhattan.'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 30, 2012
1
person found this review helpful

My teen and I stayed at Sanctuary Hotel for a week long trip this past month. I was being an indulgent mother as she chose the hotel based on the photos of the decor she saw online. I am a bit particular about where I stay and was leaning towards a big name hotel vs. a boutique hotel. Wow. What can I say? Sanctuary Hotel provided a first rate stay. And the primary reason I feel this way is because of the staff. A phenomenal bunch of young men and women who really go out of their way to take care of you. But overall, it is really a fabulous place in Midtown Manhattan.

Decor~ Check out the photos online. It is really a beautifully decorated place. I liked the darker decor, I thought it was peaceful but very, very hip. I have to admit that I was a bit cautious initially, thinking that it was going to be some sort of cool urban place with an attitude to match, but I couldn't have been more wrong. It is chic and it is very, very welcoming.

Location~ Times Square is truly steps away and around the corner from Sanctuary. Broadway is just a few steps further and Top of the Rock is about the same distance in the other direction. The subway (which we became quite proficient at) is on the corner. There is a small shop across the street for sodas or snacks and tons of restaurants, shops, etc. within walking distance. NYC is a very walkable city, so once you have the basics sorted out, it is very easy to get to Central Park and several other locations from Sanctuary. Also Grey Line bus tours is barely a block away. And the staff is always on hand to help with directions, maps...and encouragement!

Room~ The queen room was fine for two. We had plenty of room to move about, the "closet" was sufficiently large enough to hold our things for a week, the bathroom is gorgeous....overall it is a well planned out space for a city hotel. We were offered a choice of the 9th or 2nd floor upon check in and were told that we would have more natural light on the 9th floor. We were also advised that Haven, the rooftop bar, was just above us and that we "probably wouldn't be disturbed" by the noise. Hmmm. It did get loud in room 907. They woke us up two nights in a row dragging furniture across the floor at nearly 2 am. I finally, grumpily, stomped upstairs to complain. They were mortified and apologized profusely (I probably scared the hell out of them). They were very sweet and one of the guys even had me point out where our room was so they would be quieter! After this we were able to sleep fairly soundly in the room after about 11pm. I think it just is what it is. They have a fabulous rooftop bar. If you think the noise will be too much, ask for a lower floor. I don't think there's much they can do about it.

Cleanliness~ Absolutely pristine. I will say the only staff we had issues with was housekeeping (one of the maids snapped at my daughter when we asked for clean towels...she was very fortunate I didn't get her name or else I would have been downstairs at the front desk in an instant) but they still do an excellent job.

Haven Bar~ Fun. Beautiful. Friendly. Make sure you make a trip up to the rooftop to enjoy the music, the view, and a drink. Absolutely worth it. A wonderful place to slip up to after dinner in the city. I liked the bar inside the hotel as well. There they would show old, romantic movies like "An Affair to Remember" on a huge screen. And Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra are mixed in with more contemporary easy jazz singers all day long....Sigh. Such wonderful touches.


Breakfast~ The girls who serve at breakfast are amazing! They never falter at bringing you what you need or request with a smile. They dash around in these cute little black dresses as unobtrusively as possible. Never was a coffee urn empty or the pastry tray not filled...fabulous. They have bagels, bread, hard boiled eggs, pastries, a little cereal...and apples, oranges, bananas....I would suggest that maybe some Greek yogurt and granola or other kinds of fruit would be a nice change sometimes. But then again we were there for a full week. At any rate the breakfast was always plentiful and the coffee was always fresh and strong...great way to start the day.

Service~ I saved the best for last. Where to start? Let's see. There is, of course, Jacob the concierge, who would toil and hustle to get Broadway tickets or restaurant reservations or bus passes....I swear, the man is a walking encyclopedia of New York City. He has contacts all over the place and is so easy to talk to about different options for entertainment (and an occassional burst of a Gershwin tune). Also Jimmy, his sidekick at the front desk, whose droll English humor (wicked man) always made me laugh. I loved interacting with the staff....And there's Julio and the other doormen who made the place feel as safe as Fort Knox....Freddie, Brandon, Lauren....everyone was so sweet and helpful. Marta gave me written directions for the subway to Greenpoint, a Polish neighborhood in Brooklyn and we found it with no troubles. They really made our stay special.

When we were on the plane home I mentioned to my daughter that we might want to stay closer to Greenwich Village on our next stay in NYC but she firmly said "No". It's the Sanctuary Hotel or nowhere for her. This coming from a teen that I thought was happy just having her daily glass of milk and cinnamon roll for breakfast and free wi-fi. But then just yesterday she said wistfully, "Do you remember Jacob at the hotel? Wasn't he nice? Wasn't everyone nice? It was so pretty. Don't you miss it there?" Yeah. I really do.

Location: Great location. Just two straight blocks from Times Square but it's far enough to avoid the busy and unpleasant atmosphere. Three main subways around - Grand Central, 42th street Port Authority and Bryant Park. All withing walking distance. Many nice and reasonable-priced restaurants nearby.
Service: All staffs(the front desks, the cashiers, the concierges, the maids, the bell men, the bartenders, the waiters etc) are well-trained and have both good attitude and service-mind. They were all proper and very efficient.
Dining: Had breakfast 2 days at Gaby and also ordered room service. Foods were of high-quality and standard and above all these very delicious (do not taste like hotel foods but more like good restaurants)!
I paid about $345+++ to $475+++ a night (not the same rate everyday) and that worth every dollar!

We only used the hotel as a base as we were out & about all day but the room was comfortable and we enjoyed the powerful shower. A tip to smokers: it's one of the only NY hotels that allows smoking in rooms but only at floors 28-30 (superior rooms). As the weather wasn't very nice, it was nice to be able to smoke indoors & sitting after having walked miles.

Positive: A nice touch was the fruitplate for our honeymoon in our room and that we got a room on the 29th floor so we had a good view. Concierge Service was nice.

Negative: We were staying at Sofitel in Munich and Berlin, Germany before, i have to say its a total difference, the rooms at Sofitel NY are not as close luxurious as the ones in Germany and the staff is not very warm and welcoming (for instance when i arrived in my wedding dress on ,no one was there to open the door). All you pay for is the view, definately not the room. Beeing that we live in NY and have the view all the time i wish we wouldve picked another hotel! Saturday we were out of the room until 4 or 5 pm and when we came back the room was not cleaned (we didnt leave the Do not disturb sign on!). I work for hotels and this is not acceptable for the price we paid (about $420 a night)! Later an attendant came we told her to fix the room at 8 pm, but then we went out at 6pm and i told the Front desk clerk to clean the room right now instead of 8pm. Well, when we came back nothing happened. I had to call front desk again and then finally the maid came up. This shouldnt happen and i dont think Sofitel NY can meet the Standards of Sofitel Europe. Another thing is that we tried to call the front desk and housekepping and could never get a hold of anyone, the only one we got on the phone was the concierge. Its very upsetting for us because it was our wedding weekend and we expected to have a good experience since we trusted the Sofitel Brand... Definately will not recommend this hotel.

I believe the price we paid for our rooms was the best value we had during our trip to New York City. The hotel is half a block from 5th Avenue shopping and 2 blocks from Times Square. Everyone from the doormen to the front desk staff were friendly and helpful. We never had to wait more than a minute or two for a cab out front and the desk made sure our free breakfasts were erased from the bill (family package) upon check out. We will definitely stay here again and we will enthusiastically recommend this hotel to our friends that visit NYC.

I got to the hotel at about 11:15 and checked in and was told I could leave my bags, but since my sister was not there yet I told the lady at the desk that I would just sit in the lobby and maybe 30 minutes later someone brought me keys to my room!! Nearly 4 hours before check-in!! the best was the day we left though! Our flights both left late so we checked out and left our bags then went sight seeing. When we got back Alonzo let us in the guest bathroom in the lobby that is accessible by your room card but we had already checked. He then let us in the fitness room for some cold water before we left!! I will stay here again and again!!

As the title suggests, we feel that this Hotel is very nicely placed for attractions, theatres and restaurants. One avenue from Times Square (and Broadway), you just simply cross the road, walk 250 yards and Times Square is looking at you!
The Hotel staff are very friendly and attentive, the rooms are absolutely fine - clean, tidy, decent size for a City Hotel and everything works well. Good continental breakfast is part of the deal and there is a good selection from fresh fruit salad, yoghurt, cereals, toast and sticky buns, waffles, scrambled egg and sausages plus decent coffee! A great base to stay at.
Plenty to do in NY? Second time we have been, but still left not seeing it all!
If you want a nice and easy way of starting off your visit and want to tour around some, then there is a Gray line shop just 3 streets down from the Hotel. Here you can buy 1-3 day 'hop on hop off' bus passes and they either run uptown or downtown. To start the uptown loop it is a few yards away from the shop, the other loop is from Times Square so it couldn't be easier. So a nice way to get taken around with very good commentary from a guy or girl on the bus delivered often with some good humour mixed in! So you can simply plan your visits around the relevant stops made by the buses.
We also used the underground/Metro which is perfectly easy to get you about - ticket machines are straight forward enough, but if in doubt there are plenty of people around to ask.
Then of course there are the cabs, got to be done! Just fling yourself out in the road a bit and you will get a cab OK and they were not as expensive as we thought they might be.
I am sure readers most probably know where they want to go already, but a few thoughts:
9/11 Memorial Gardens - very poignant and you cannot but help to be affected by it. We were in NY 4 years ago and at that stage ground zero building was going on, but still below ground. Now the new tower is looming over the skyline and whilst not finished, it is now taller than the Empire State building.
Once you have left the Memorial - Brooklyn bridge is across the road and is certainly worth walking across and good photo opportunities. Or get back on the bus and next stop is Wall Street and just below this is Battery Park. Here you can buy tickets to go on the ferry to Liberty Island and Ellis Island (it stops at both in the same trip). Of course the Statue of Liberty is iconic and a 'must do', but Ellis Island is also well worth a visit and the museum there is very interesting around the history of immigration into the United States.
You can also take the Staten Island ferry from Battery Park and this is absolutely free - so if you want to take pictures of the New York skyline or photograph the Statue of Liberty, then this is a good way of doing so.
Empire State building - you know you need to do it! I would personally buy a fastpass on the website as if you are limited in time this is a good way to sneak past big queues.
Rockefeller Center - well worth a whizz up to the top and there are some great views from there.
Central Park is lovely and you can't go to this City without a walk in the park! Zoo at the South East end, boating lake south west end.
There's loads more to do, but finally one other thing you should do is go to the theatre. This time we went to see Ghost (theatre just down the road) and it really was an excellent show. Very funny at times, sad at others but the special effects are stunning and you leave feeling you have been thoroughly entertained!
So, if you are going to New York - you will have a great time.
If you are thinking about it - for goodness sake just get it booked!

This hotel was picked for several reasons that were important for our family. Location (close to Gershwin theatre with Wicked) and subway stations, free Breakfast (hot with plenty of choices), free 24 hr coffee/tea/hot chocolate and apples for snacking, Queen beds instead of double beds. Our family has 2 teens so breakfast saved us a bundle each day. Coming back to the hotel after our busy sightseeing days, the free hot drinks and apples were a welcoming touch. We also appreciated the queen beds instead of doubles which with teens sharing a bed is a must for keeping the peace. Next door to the hotel are plenty of food choices and a drug store for things forgotten. Laundry mat down the street was helpful when drenched with tennis shoes at Statue of Liberty (45 minutes later and 6 quarters problem was solved). Hotel was even able to accomodate a late check out after they checked their schedule when we asked them. We were able to leave directly from hotel to airport which was a nice way to end our stay since we were exhausted. No complaints.

Location was great, 8 min walk to time square and surrounded by subways. The front desk, breakfast staff and bellmen were friendly and inviting. The 2 dbl room worked perfect for 4 people and didn't seemed cramped. The a/c however seemed to lag which would have upset me in the summer but it was comfy for the days we were there. I do wish there was a fridge however I don't expect there to be one. I loved out view facing 8th st, just waking up and looking out the window to see all those taxis driving by added to my "you're in NY moment". The walls seem to be thin but we didn't have any complaints. The free breakfast was amazing and was just the perfect way to start the day. I read reviews that is was really busy and to go early but didn't run into this problem. The only thing I had to wait maybe for a minute was the waffle maker since there is only two but it was nothing. Had to use the business corner a couple of time and fax some documents which was a breeze. We were in town during Fleet Week and didn't feel like it was ever to crowded until the last day we left which started off Memorial Day weekend

When we arrived, we were greeted immediately, invited to have breakfast and our luggage was tagged with a smile. After breakfast, (which was very nice and not overly crowded) the gentleman at the desk said that he would call to see if our room was ready. (It was still morning.) We were doubtful, but were told that we could check in and go to our room. This wonderful courtesy made our day! There were computers available for guests and comfy beds with fresh duvets. The hotel went above and beyond our expectations.

Easy access to subway also so ideal for sight seeing. The rooms were very comfortable, not a bad size for NYC standards, bed was comfortable and bathroom was good. Air con and wi-fi in the room and tea and coffee making facilities. Hotel staff were always pleasant and happy to help, nice lounge area with access to computers for printing tickets etc. We had a lovely stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel to other tourists visiting New York and wanting to be in a good location. On a NYC note definitely buy the New York passes if you are planning on doing all the sights we saved about 100 as a result of having these passes. Also for a superb meal if you want an extra special evening go to Ruth Chris' Steakhouse on the same street as the hotel down towards times square, best food in New York and excellent service.

We visited New York over Memorial weekend. From the moment we arrived at the Jewel the staff were extremely cheery and helpful and check in was very smooth. Being a fairly new hotel in Manhattan it has a contemporary feel that other hotels lack. The reception is small but has a nice seating area if you are awaiting for a transfer at the end of your holiday. Alternatively, there is a lounge on the second floor with complimentary drinking facilities, free access to computers and a lovely seating area. The added bonus here is you can check in for your return flight (If applicable) with complete ease at your own leisure.

The room we stayed in was the smallest double room; although certainly not too small. Some people may complain about the size, but it is rare to find a large room in any hotel in Manhattan unless your paying the big bucks for a penthouse. Why would you need any bigger? Cleanliness of the room was fantastic, and the little touches such as the i-pod docking station, coffee machine, fridge and microwave just added that extra luxury. Considering we were staying in Midtown, sleep was completely uninterrupted and I wasn't woken once by any noise.

On each floor there is water machine with complimentary water bottles for guests. What a great idea; something I have not seen before and we took complete advantage of. I did not use the gym on the fifth floor, but along with the vending machine, ice machine and free use of the washing machine these were further innovative ideas to accommodate guests' needs.

We did not visit the Terrace club situated nearby but there was a gift of a complimentary drink and discounted food courtesy of the Jewel.

Overall, our stay was completely perfect at the Jewel. Situated in Midtown, whether it is your first time in Manhattan or you are returning I would 100% recommend The Jewel as a trustworthy hotel that has a lot to offer.

We typically stay in 4-star hotels but decided to try this one because of the price, design, location and good previous reviews.
I suppose the test of any hotel is how they handle it when things go wrong. So I'll share both the good and the bad. Check in: We arrived at 2:00 and were told we had to wait until 3:00 to check in so they held our luggage in the hotel storage. This was a little stressful since we had to be across town for business, but based on older reviews about lost reservations, we decided to wait nearby for an hour by walking around Rockefeller Center, which is just across the street (great location).
We came back at 3:00 to check in and were promptly given a room on the 15th floor where I thoroughly checked the bed since I had heard that all New York hotels might have bedbugs, even the nice ones. For the first time in my travels over 20 years, I actually found a bug between the mattress and box spring, alive and crawling. I am not a bug expert and it became evident the hotel staffperson would not acknowledge it was a bedbug without their own independent investigation. Not being aware that the burden of proof is on the guest, I failed to take a photo or trap it and later they said they did not find it. However, they assured us they take these kinds of things seriously and did the right thing and accommodated our request to be moved to a different room several floors away, which was bug-free for the rest of our 5 night stay. We were so glad to have a new bug-free room we decided not to mention that we had booked a room with a view and stayed in our new room facing an alley, which was very quiet.
The room decor was basic but nice and the standard room was sufficiently spacious. The bed was a little too close to the window AC unit which made it uncomfortable at night with blowing cold air directly on the person closest to the window. It was nice to have an operable window in the room, but it was a little too warm during our stay to use it. Sliding doors on bathrooms look nice but provide no acoustical privacy. The shower curtain was a strangely lower-grade design choice in a bathroom with mostly upscale finishes and I wish they had replaced it between guests or at least every few days (didn't look like it). The tile grout, fixtures, and surfaces were clean and shiny.
The filtered water (with bottles) available in the hall was a very nice amenity which we used every day. If you're looking for the ironing board, you have to get it from a common hall closet but we had no trouble once they told us where to find it.
Checkout is at noon but our plane would not depart until 8pm so the hotel was nice enough to store our luggage and allow us to use the second floor lounge to freshen up when we returned at 5:00 to pick up our luggage and head to LaGuardia. They called a car service but no one was available so we walked down to St. Patrick's Cathedral to hail a cab and got lucky on the 3rd try (first two said they would not go to the airport)- we were his last fare before shift change and he was heading home near the airport. I would recommend to anyone to arrange for car service a day ahead at least, especially if you're trying to hail a cab to the airport at rush hour.
Overall this is a nice looking hotel with basic services and that is what you pay for. It was a decent value in a great location and for New York, I think they passed the test.

The hotel is in an excerlent location just a few minutes walk to Times Sq.
Air con was good and not to noisey
Roof top terrace was great for a afternoon drink after returning from a hectic day shopping
The hotel is split into 2 centre each 3 doors away from each other but both having a reception but only 1 has the bar and resturant
Would recommend for a great mid priced hotel in a great location

I can only echo all of the other good reviews about the Jewel!

It's best feature is it's location, literally steps from Radio City Music Hall and Rockafeller Centre! Such a perfect base for exploring the city. Some rough walking times from the hotel:

Rockafeller Centre - 2 minutes
St Patricks Cathedral - 2 minutes
Times Square - 10 minutes
Central Park - 15 minutes
Empire State Building - 20 minutes
Madison Square Gardens - 25 minutes
Museum of Natural History - 45 minutes

That's pretty much everywhere we walked, the subway is so accessable but as it was our first time in the city, wanted to take everything in!

Room was clean, modern, good shower and a comfy bed - everything you need when you're not spending too much time there! Free water bottles on every floor, the hotel doesn't have it's own restaurant but has a range of nearby restaurants that delivery - we had breakfast one morning that was delicious!

Staff in the lobby were always happy, chatty and willing to answer any questions/help with directions etc.

I definitely felt like we got good value for money too! Would 100% come back to stay!

Booked the London for an anniversary trip to NY, we had a great time. From our arrival we where made to feel welcome as we had booked for our anniversary we had a complimentary room upgrade, bottle of wine and a nice handwritten letter from the manager. The rooms were very spacious the suite layout was quite modern but not in a bad way. We have stayed in NYC and never had rooms as big as these for the price. On the day of our departure my parents received a bill for the stay even though it was prepaid. This was quite a shock for them and a worry.The front desk manager Tony could not have been more helpful, he took the booking voucher and resolved the problem in a matter of minutes and reassured my parents all was well. It was excellent service.
The hotel was a good base for sightseeing and there were a number of places to eat locally, everything from Deli's to top class restaurants. It was my parents first trip to NYC and they loved it.
I would like to thank all the staff for making our stay so enjoyable.

The front checkin staff was very friendly and let us know that our room was not ready, not surprising, given that we were there at 9 a.m. However, they did check! When we did check in closer to 3, the room that we had was just incredible. So spacious with a separate sitting area, bedroom with two beds and a bathroom that was just huge - beautiful details in the tile with a deep, deep tub. Even the amenities in the bathroom - robes, slippers, etc. The beds themselves - ahhhh, just heavenly. Our room was very quiet, also.

We plan to go back same time next year and stay at the London. Why would I go anywhere ese?

I'm disappointed to say that this property has not living up to my expectations. Although I booked two suites through AMEX Platinum FHR, the service has been, at best, shoddy and at worst downright mean.

After having my plans change such that I couldn't accompany my family to NY this weekend, I called in advance and advised the hotel of the change. They assured me that all was taken care of and asked me to fax an authorization to them, which I did in advance. To wit, when my Mother in law arrived, tired from a long international trip to NYC, she was treated coldly and asked to provide a credit card although I had already made arrangements to pre pay. Further, when my partner and sister in law arrived a bit later, they were treated even worse, notwithstanding my arrangements they were made to wait until after 1030 pm until finally they were also asked to provide another credit card and were advised coldly that none of the FHR benefits would be provided to them.

All this after multiple phone calls from me. Very disappointing. Service in the hospitality industry is ALL about finding ways to provide stress relief from long travels and to be made to feel welcome, as if in one's own home. I'd ask the staff that treated my family so poorly how they would feel if their own father or mother were treated in such a way as they have treated mine.

I am a loyal AMEX platinum card holder for many years, mainly because of the travel benefits, but never again at this property. The team at the Gramercy Park, Nomad or The Greenwich would have welcome my family with a smile, a nod and assurances that all was well as the details were worked out. London NYC, take note, this is why you will never be a player in the high end market.

Minor things though, as this is a fabulous choice if you are after a classy, super hip hotel in New York.

The location is fab and the rooms are very clean-contemporary. The decor is minimalist-Brit and actually very appealing in the layout. The service matches the style - lighthearted and to the point. The lobby is small and welcoming (to retain a personal, boutique-feel) but note that this place will not check you in before 3pm except in very rare instances - the late check out is guaranteed, so plan accordingly. The higher floor rooms facing Central Park are a must. For a special birthday we obtained the corner room on 42nd floor. Absolutely breathtaking view. The showers are a true highlight here: One rain shower option and the other a high-pressure shower head. Plentiful counter space but I do wish they had better upgraded bath toiletries like Brit Molton Brown stuff, perhaps... instead of the current no-brand they use? All in all it's a good place to crash and take in the UES vibe while in NY.

The hotel hosted the CW upfronts in May which made it crowded to get in and out of with camera wielding kids at the exterior of door at all hours day and night. Celebrities were sighted at all hours in the lobby and elevators - but it all retained a quietness on the hotel's inside. The construction causes no discomfort - you never hear it if you're there in the evening and leaving by 11am. If they did not have the construction contraptions around the front hotel facade, you'd never guess there was anything of the sort happening - unless you're unfortunate to get a room which is covered up by the crews, so keep your room preferences open and clear in advance to the hotel.

Cons: The London Bar is a pretty place but: the booths are a tad worn down, the service is lame from the youngish (on trial looking) staff and the afternoon tea sucks - we were unceremoniously informed that they prepare sandwiches the night prior so it's not a fresh offering - oh and they do expect you to 'study' their tea menu well in advance because if you have a dietary issue with their offerings, they'll simply take that item off with no alternate or replacement - because "all sandwiches have to be accounted for well ahead of your arrival". On a very warm spring day the said sandwiches must have been stored at room temperature overnight because the bread was off and dry-stale for all the tea sandwiches. Rubbish attitude.

We loved this hotel. It was a special occasion so we were prepared to pay more to ensure we were not disappointed. The suite was large and beautifully decorated in pale blue and silver with carpet in bedroom and wooden floor in separate lounge which had plenty of window seating and a rocking chair. Walk through wardrobe to shower room with large double shower added to sense of space. We were on the 29th floor and it was very quiet - looking across 55th Street which is not too busy. Only disappointment was that our view of the park was a glimpse through many other buildings despite paying for a Vista suite and asking for a view for our special occasion. Did not complain as everything else was so good. Restaurant and bar in hotel were excellent and staff were all friendly and efficient. Expect to pay a lot for room service and breakfast but it is good quality.

Really didn't want to spend a lot on a hotel room, but that's not easily done in New York, especially if there are 3 people. We arrived at about 11am, our room was ready and they let us check in early... a full day to site see!! Price was very reasonable by New York standards. Room had a king bed and a sofa/futon type bed. Bed was heavenly and the maid sevice made up the sofa bed everyday so it was ready when we got back. Great view from our room, though I couldn't say what direction it was.
Room also had complimentary coffee maker, frig, microwave and safe; it had a hairdryer and iron/ironing board. While shopping for rooms in New York, I found that these types of ameneties are not the norm as room space is typically very small. Can't say enough about the hospitality: always pleasant, helpful and personable. No matter what time we got in(sometimes very late), there was always a pleasant person to great us. Hotel is close to EVERYTHING!!! About the only thing that could have made it any better would have been breakfast included. I will definately stay here again when in the BIg Apple.

Myself and 3 friends just spent 3 nights over the week-end at The Hilton Garden Inn Times Square. This hotel was in the best location. We had Times Square 1 block away, Hells Kitchen a block the opposite way and the Theatres we're all around us. Our room was a great size and very clean. We had 2 queen size beds, complimentary WiFi, coffee maker, safe in the closet, great view looking toward the Hudson, could even see the cruise ships in Port and very comfy beds. They serve complimentary Starbucks coffee and Tazo teas in the lobby every mornng which was very handy. There are also yummy cookies available at the front desk. If needed there is a business office where you have access to computers and or printer. They also loaned us umbrellas the one evening as it was calling for rain. One of the nicest things about this hotel is the staff. From the second we checked in to to the second we left every staff member was extremely friendly and very helpful. We felt so at home. One of the staff even called our room to check in with us to make sure all was good and was there anything they could do for us. I would highly recommend this hotel if you plan on visiting New York City. You will not be disappointed.

Charles, bellman, was funny and helpful with subway directions and catching us a cab. Joanna was very personable and had shopping suggestions too. Check-in and Check-out was fast and convenient. There is a little pantry in the lobby area to purchase beverages, snacks, etc.. Free coffee is available in the lobby during morning hours. The internet is complimentary which is a plus. The heart of Times Square is about 5 blocks away, and one subway station is about a block away. Central Park is about 8 blocks away. NOTE - A SUBWAY TRAIN RUNS UNDERGROUND OF THE HOTEL. We had a 2nd floor room and could hear the subway throughout the evening - it runs less during off peak hours. If you are in the lobby, you may feel the subway roar under you. The restaurant that is connected to the hotel is pretty good. The Hilton Garden Inn has a restaurant (connected/next door) with a $19.99 breakfast buffet including coffee and juice which is very average tasting but a good price. I viewed the workout room which has nice machines and is very small. The room was clean and had a nice flat screen tv.
Good value for your money!

It was great fun watching the hustling and bustling from the 5th floor but once we closed the window, the noise was minimized... not at all bothersome. We had a microwave, fridge and coffee maker with coffee in our room and, upon arrival, a gift with bottles of water, goodies, etc. We truly did feel at home. The room was kept spotlessly clean and it was a large room with 2 queen beds and still lots of room for a desk, large dresser, and microwave stand. Every morning when leaving the hotel, we were greeted with smiles and questions we had about the city were answered with lots of additional information. The restaurant and lounge were inviting. We enjoyed a dinner and breakfast there, both were very good with excellent service. The small store was also stocked with anything we needed in the moment. One of the best things was the location of the hotel... right in the middle of the theatre district and the heart of Times Square.... we were able to walk everywhere ..... and the subway was right across the street as well. We highly recommend this hotel ..... the cost is comparable to other hotels in Manhattan.

The room and bathroom were very small, but I'm sure that's to be expected in NYC. Our room faced Eighth Ave., and our biggest complaint was the noise coming from the street, particularly sirens from the nearby firehouse. I slept through most of the noise, but my husband, who is a light sleeper, was awoken many times each night. We loved the little French restaurant that is connected, where we had coupons for breakfast each morning. It was a delicious full breakfast buffet unlike the run-of-the-mill breakfasts at most hotels. The food and service there were both wonderful. We would definitely stay here again but would request location facing the back of the property.

The staff were friendly and very helpful. The room (two double beds) was large, nicely appointed and very clean. There was a roomy desk with comfortable chair and wi-fi was available free of charge. In addition to the two beds and desk, there was a comfortable upholstered chair with ottoman. A small alcove contained a refrigerator, microwave and coffeepot. The bathroom was roomy and modern. The elevators was very efficient with very little waiting time no matter the time of day. The continental breakfast was complimentary and was served just off the main lobby from 7-10 AM daily. Yogurt, sweet rolls, bagels, toast and cereal as well as coffee, tea and orange juice were available. By NYC standards, the room rates were very reasonable. I think I have found a new "go-to" hotel for my visits to NYC!

Over the last 6 years we have stayed at the San Carlos Hotel at least 4 times. In between we tried a few different hotels which were good but ended up returning to the San Carlos because, as a whole, nothing can beat it. All personnel treat you like royalty and the rooms are beyond clean (I am a germaphobe) and updated. The continental breakfast suffices if you're not a big hot breakfast person (they have yogurts, danishes, cold cereals, apples, cottage cheese and hot drinks as well as juice).

The rooms are quite large and well laid out and you can't beat the location with an easy walk to TImes Square and Central Park.

We decided to stop trying out other hotels - this will be our destination for our yearly trip to NYC.

I accidently rated the spa and pool, both of which I don't know if they have.

Bathroom was small but functional. Breakfast was included but I didn't try it - looked like the usual continental buffet. My only hesitation in recommending this hotel is a very limited room service menu that comes from the Indian restaurant next door. The food was pedestrian and the delivery person hit me up for a tip in cash- a rather odd exchange. No silverware came with the meal - the idea was to use the silver from the kitchen but then plates and silver stayed until the next morning. Otherwise, my stay was good and I would go back. It is away from the hustle and bustle but very well located.

Don't understand the other Trip Advisor reviews which say the complimentary breakfast leaves anything to be desired-the selection is vast, fresh and presented beautifully. There are plenty of great options and this benefit allows you to start your day early and not have to spend any money. We will be back here again and again and again...

This was an adequate stay for a reasonable price.

The hotel is well situated on E 50th; across the street are both the Benjamin and Affinia 50, so others might want to try them for comparison.

There's nothing special about the property. The reception lounge is relatively small yet efficient. The executive room I took was ok, decent space, comfortable sofa and chairs, workable kitchen facilities - but not of a quality of a place like the Alex. Bathroom was small yet functional - ok water pressure and Aveda giveaways. Bed quality was fine.

Two gripes were the towels and the continental breakfast. The towels were so worn and thin that I thought their sandpaper-like quality might exfoliate my entire body without ever really drying it. Really, it was like a bad summer camp experience. And the continental breakfast was bland, cheap in quality and tasteless. The hotel management must have someone specifically picking up months supplies of huge quantities of nourishment at BJs or Walmart.

So, if you want that location (50th and 3rd) for a decent night's sleep, grab a discounted rate and avoid the breakfast. It's a decent enough place for a night or two (p.s. go get a breakfast bagel at Ess-A-Bagel and coffee across the street and don't even try to justify the embedded continental breakfast cost).

The television reception on some of the stations in my room (#1009) could have been better bu this small factor is not severe enough to lower my rating of the hotel. It is in every possible way five star. The continental breakfast provided every morning with the cost of your room is fine. Best of all the location is excellent for every type of sightseeing you could want to do in Manhattan.

'Great hotel in a great location!'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 28, 2012

The staff is very friendly and helpful. The lobby is completely updated and new. Rooms were kind of small, but the bathroom was very modern. If you are looking to stay in the SoHo area, this is your place. It's also 1 block away from the "1" train in which you can access the entire west side of Manhattan.

This hotel is perfectly located in SoHo, across the street from the subway. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was extremely clean and comfortable, decor was modern, and the view was great. The staff handed out roses to all of the mother's on Mother's Day, which was a nice touch.

'Communication problems'
2 of 5 stars Reviewed June 4, 2012 NEW

I wish I didn't have a negative review for a hotel that has many positive aspects. But here goes I arrived a little after the 3 pm check-in time and wasn't surprised to hear that they weren't quite ready to hand over my room key yet. After all, it was a Saturday at a popular hotel in NYC these things happen. So I had a seat in their (beautiful) lobby. And I paid attention. During the course of nearly an hour, I observed the earnest front-desk staff attempt to get verification from housekeeping as to the readiness of the rooms (I was one of several guests awaiting check-in). Those status requests seem to evaporate into thin air, because the front-desk folks had to try again, and again and again. Now, I don't proclaim to understand the ins and outs of running a hotel, but it stands to reason that each day by 3 pm, a well-oiled system is in place to have the housekeeping check completed  or to communicate any issues to the front desk along with a very accurate estimate as to the timing of a resolution. That was not the case here that day.

I compliment the front-desk staff for their grace under pressure, and I appreciate manager on duty Kiana for recognizing the need for a bit of service recovery. At 4 pm, I was finally in my room; and she did send up a nice amenity of almonds, etc. The room was very appealing; not huge, but fresh and modern. Soon I discovered, though, that the bathroom sink stopper was fully engaged, and no amount of effort to open it was successful. That meant washing hands, brushing teeth, etc. in the shower. As I left for the evening, I noted this issue to the front desk person, who wrote it into a log. By the time I came back, after midnight, the problem remained. I would have shrugged it off had there been any indication  a note, a voice mail message  that someone had inspected it and determined that it would be best to wait until my checkout the next day, take the room out of service and fix it. That I would have understood. But instead, there was no sign that it had been investigated. I wondered once again about their issues with communication.

Now, if I were reading this review, I think I would take a chance and stay at the hotel anyway (if I got a great rate). The positive things that others have written are valid. The location is great (granted, 'Times Square South' is a stretch of a description of W. 35th St., but whatever), the dcor is pleasing, free wifi is awesome and I did get quite a deal. But next time I'm in New York, I'll look elsewhere. It's too bad, because were it not for these communication problems, this could have been my go-to place.

It's a new hotel, so everything is CLEAN and SHINY NEW. If you do stay in a Premier Room, you will be wowed, as it's a large room, and large is not what you would expect in NYC.
The Tryp is in a good location.

Stayed here for my first time in NYC over Memorial Day weekend. Called ahead and let them know my flight was arriving in the morning and was told if my room was available I could check in early. Was able to check in around 11am which was really nice to be able to settle in and take a load off. Had a queen sized standard room. Comfy bed, nice sized flat screen and cool looking bathroom and overall furnishings. Also plenty of convenient outlets to plug in your gizmos. Even had an ihome alarm clock to dock my phone. Friendly staff and liked the vibe of the place, not at all like a cookie cutter chain hotel (even though this is part of the Wyndham franchise).

The only big drawback for me was location. Definitely felt safe (midtown police precinct is literally next door) but this place isn't nearly as close to Times Square as I thought. It is definitely "South", like 12 blocks south. Subway station is at the end of the block so anywhere you want to go it's not hard, but must admit after a couple of late nights out on the town in the Times Square area it would have been nice to have home base a little bit closer.

Couple of other minor drawbacks:
- Hotel bar closes at midnight or earlier despite room menu that says it closes at 2. Got back around 1am my first night, was planning on getting a late night snack and drink for the room but found out that they were already closed There are not a lot of options in the immediate area (avoid Tick-Tock diner) so it would be nice to have in-hotel option but at least don't advertise that it's open later.

- No bedside lighting in the room. Didn't really need it but I think it would be nice. Just had overhead lighting and lamp bracketed to the desk side of the room.

Overall a satisfying stay, staff was great but if you're planning on spending a good amount of time in the Times Square/Broadway area just be aware of where this location actually is.

My wife and I stayed at the TRYP Times Square South for one night May 9, 2012, on a return trip from Europe. I read the positive reviews on Trip Advisor and felt we were lucky to book this hotel. Before I start on the negative points, I do have to say that the staff we dealt with were courteous and professional at all times. So I would give the guest services staff at least a 4.
We had an excellent check in experience and very satisfied with our room. When we returned from dinner, we pulled down the covers on one of the beds. The sheets were littered with black flecks and hairs. We called the desk and the night manager was in our room immediately. She told us that the flecks were fuzz from the laundry bins but the hairs were unacceptable. She took photos and told us that she would move our room. She returned a while later and took us to another room. As we settled into the new room we noticed that both bed skirts were covered with red wine stains and foot prints. There was also a large black stain on the wall. We were too tired to complain again that night and decided to speak to the manager in the morning. While we were getting showered, my wife discovered that the hair dryer did not work. We called the day manager and she came the room to apologize for the situation. She said that the bed skirt stains were not acceptable, but the stain on the wall was just glue. We felt for a hotel of this quality, glue stains on the wall were not acceptable either.
The manager gave a breakfast comp and box of nuts and candy. When we spoke to her later she promised to call us the following week to let us know what the hotel would do to change our TRYP experience. It is now two weeks later and no phone call, despite our calling asking the manager to return our phone calls.
My wife and I are not very concerned with hotel amenities but cleanliness of beds, bedding and rooms are critical to an enjoyable stay for us.
This is first bad review I have written and I hope it is the last.

'Week with Teens in LA'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 5, 2012 NEW

In reviewing several of the comments about this hotel prior to my visit, I was a little worried about what I had to look forward to, however, upon arrival all my fears were put to rest. We booked through hotwire and got a $160 per night rate and were very happy with what we received for this price. The hotel lobby is very nice, the rooms were good, however a little small, and the pool area was just right, especially having a hot tub that our teens were in every night. While this may not sound like a resounding endorsement, the thing that really stood out to me outside of the "bricks and mortar" was the customer service. From the greeting we received upon arrival back every day from the outdoor bell staff, to the friendliness of the concierge and other hotel staff, I would rate their service a 5 out of 5, and felt like they truely had my interest at heart in trying to deliver whatever service they could.

Beyond this, for us, the location was also excellent. When in LA, you hear most people say prepare to be in traffic during a portion of your trip. And while this is true to some degree, we felt we were only 20 minutes from any major tourist area such as Venice Beach, Santa Monica, Hollywood, or downtown, and having the Beverly Hills/UCLA area a mile away and a nice outdoor mall next door, you could not get much better.

Overall, if you are anything other than a couple looking for a dramatically romantic place to stay, then the Hyatt should be in your top five for places to consider.

All too often when you check into a hotel you feel anonymous. Not at this Hyatt Regency--from the doorman, front desk and every other staff member i encountered i received smiles and a warm welcome.I have stayed here before, but by no means am i a "regular" At most I come to LA once a year. They had my profile stored and from then on everyone called me by name--a nice touch! When I checked into the room I noticed that one of the lamps was broken. I called housekeeping and was answered with my name--not room number! Within 5 minutes someone was at the door to fix the problem. As it could not be repaired quickly within 10 minutes a new lamp was delivered. Service does not get any better than that!

The rooms are spacious and clean and all have balconies--a nice place for your morning coffee. Amenities are what you expect from this type of hotel. Other things--like the pool area, bars and restaurants are all well run. It's so nice to be in a hotel that runs smoothly.

As this is LA everything is measured by distance--this location is very good--not too far from the Airport, Westwood, Beverly Hills and even to the Getty Museum which I wanted to visit.

It's quiet as well. No need to look further for a good hotel in LA.

Lest you think I'm a shill for the hotel--if you read my other reviews, I'm not always this complementary.

One side note for smokers--this hotel offers rooms for smokers that have air purifiers-- another nice touch so the hallways and room do not reek of smoke odors.

The lobby, hallways, bar and restaurant are beautiful. All rooms come with a balcony and fully opening sliding glass door. Room 1023 was quite spacious and the cool fresh breeze coming in from the balcony was a great improvement over the stale air conditioned air found in all too many hotels with sealed windows.

The chair and ottoman were very comfortable and the letter desk came with 2 first rate office style chairs.

The bathroom was large and really just beautiful. The toiletries were made by Hyatt's usual brand Portico. If you haven't tried these let me say that they are better than average hotel toiletries.

On the down side the carpet in my room was just beginning to show wear.

Stayed here for a legal conference and this was one of the nicest conference facilities I've been to. The staff was top notch at all of our meals and the food was surprisingly good.

The bar/pool/restaurant area is very nice but was quite crowded and noisy.

Be prepared for being nickle and dimed on everything - parking is $36 per night if you want access to your car, in-room internet costs extra (not sure about lobby - although free wifi was provided for our conference).

Rooms are much larger than I was expecting.

Front desk staff could use improvement. Had some snafus at check-in (originally sent to a room that didn't exist, then sent to a room that was not what I had reserved, and then finally ended up in a "correct room"). At check-out, they double charged me for parking and it took a good 15 minutes to straighten out (and thank goodness I double checked the bills or I would have had a problem with my corporate credit card!).

Location was good - next to the mall is super convenient for easy dining and entertainment. It cost my coworker $50 for a taxi from the airport, which is quite a bit more than what the hotel website advises.

Pinkberry at the mall = love for me

Bonus: The Valet staff is amazing!!!! Very polite and always there to help. Our vehicle was too high to fit in the self parking so they let us park in their gated delivery area. Every staffer we encountered was very personable and treated us like friends.

Staff continually recognize their guests throughout their stay. They truly wish to accomodate your desires. The staff offered assistance before we asked for it. The concierge took great pleasure in making food recommendations, immediatly provided directions from off the top of their head without having to look up anything. One night we had a show to see and wanted a reservation following the show...the concierge looked up the show length and made a reservation at a time that followed the show end time and allowed time to travel to the restaurant. All recommendations were great.

I went to run in Central Park on Friday and they offered water up my return without me asking for it. They inquired about the length of my run and two days later remembered me and asked if I was going to run again.

We called for ice and they quickly fulfilled the request with no follow up. The spa was wonderful and staff were experts in their trade. Very knowledgeable and courteous, wish I had gone to the spa sooner, went on the last day as they have a steam room within the spa. They also have a relaxation area and a music menu to select the type of music you wish to experience for your treatment. Staff were very nice and welcoming without pressuring one to purchase their La Prairie products. They sent a complementary gift up to the room following the spa service.

Look forward to my return to this hotel!

We appreciated the quiet of this hotel. Stayed over a weekend, which can be noisy. But not here. Got the sense you were in an isolated location. Very nice.
Didn't eat at the hotel. Too many places which were close.
Staff was probably the friendliest I have ever encountered. Anything we needed, they were there to help.
Would definately stay again and recommend to others.

This hotel has a lot going for it as far as the hardwiring is concerned- to start the location is perfection - around the corner from Fifth Avenue and right across from Central Park. You have the best of New York laid at your feet. The rooms are timelessly elegant and generous in size. The bed among the best I have ever experienced... BUT to quote Gertrude Stein "There is no there there".

The staff and service, the soul of any great hotel, are wildly disparate and range from truly excellent to borderline disgruntled. Several times there was no one at the door including when I first arrived with luggage in the middle of the afternoon and after arriving back after the theatre late at night. Check in was somewhat perfunctory and it was the first time I was not upgraded as an Amex Plat card holder which is fair enough if they have no rooms available however upon check-in the guaranteed late checkout of 4pm was confirmed by the clerk at her initiative which I did appreciate. On my final day, at a little after the regular check out time I received a call thanking me for the stay and well, in short asking me to leave! Taken aback but thinking this was a misunderstanding, I assured the clerk that the guaranteed check out at 4pm was confirmed by one of his colleagues but instead of apologizing he just asked me when I would leave and said that my keycard (which is used for both the room and elevator and was faulty the entire time of my 3 night stay) would no long work and if I intended on staying I would have to come to the front desk. I was so disgusted I packed up and left with a very bitter taste in my mouth and astonished at the rudest treatment I have ever experienced at any hotel. I am the type of person who always checks out 5 minutes before the time and If they were pressured for rooms they could have handled this a lot better. To add insult to injury the bill contained several mischarges in the favor of the hotel including all three breakfasts (which were included in my rate) charged as lunch. It was quickly remedied but still this shouldn't happen at a hotel of this caliber.

While I rather like this hotel doesn't have a large impersonal lobby it is missing a great bar like Bemelmans at the Carlyle or the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis.

Most importantly and sadly, however, I found the Ritz-Carlton Central Park lacking in any sort of graciousness or charm.

The staff at this hotel are all extremely friendly and eager to help. But the best part of the hotel is the room. I spend 150+ nights/year in hotel rooms and this one was by far my favorite. The room was bright with a great view of the park, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom and bedroom were both large enough that my husband and I never felt like we were getting in each others way. Unfortunately, my husband and I both got food poisoning on this trip (not from eating at this hotel), but if it had to happen I am glad we were at this hotel. That may be the only downside - the room is so nice you don't want to leave it.

I kept running over to Bergdorfs while my husband cat- napped, just to breathe in the exquisite designer offerings- you will never see so much so beautifully,serenely displayed in any other store in NY.I walk in their doors and literally float through the store..And of course Tiffany is just across the street.Good restaurants around the corner too-Rue 57 on 57th st for one. Sarabeths a few doors down from hotel has lovely omlettes,and indoor,outdoor seating. Note- Marriott East Side behind the Waldorf is actually pretty fine too. And- they are around the corner from Avra- a high end, yet casual enough busy Greek restaurant.You can pick out a whole fish from their in house fish market and have it cooked anyway you like.Delicious bread basket,everything fresh and tastey, not cheap, but worth the splurge.I always end up taliking about food!

My husband and I flew into Philadelphia, rented a car and drove to New York to stay at the Ritz-Carlton Battery Park where we had made reservations a couple months earlier. Our GPS took us to the Central Park location instead of Battery Park...we had unloaded our car and they had parked it before we realized the mistake. Instead of being treated like tourists who didn't have a clue (which we were) they quickly found us a room in this location. However, we wanted to stay in the Ritz where we made reservations. They graciously let us leave our car at their hotel, found us a cab and sent us on our way. When we arrived at the Battery Park location we were treated like royalty and they continued to pamper us for the remainder of our stay. The concierge was very helpful in helping us zone in on the best things the city has to offer for our short stay. The concierge ordered us a limo, after 6 hours of walking from lower Manhattan to mid town, to see the city at night and he was one of the drivers for the Apprentice contestants...he drove us all night to see the city that never sleeps...he was wonderful, informative and a great historian...We never met an unfriendly person in all of New York and the staff (and luscious rooms) made it a trip worth remembering!

Ender, the accomplished and passionate welcoming host who escorted my wife and I to our beautiful room, overlooking Central Park, gushed when he talked about the pride that he and the other employees of The Ritz Carlton Central park shared.
24 hours we checked out fully convinced that they had every rite to be proud. In the Ritz Carlton world, one that always demonstrates superior service, the Ritz Carlton stands tall. In the world of normal hotels.... they don't stand a chance.
Awesome in every move. Not a single slip. Room was perfect and just what we had expected. Employees I had not even met greeted us by name (I've got to figure out how they do that? Do they have pictures of guests in the employee lounge?)... everyone greeted us with that warm "welcome home".
It was a one night trip up to see a Barry Manilow concert at Radio City. We mentioned that to the staff when we checked in. After a great evening on the town and at the concert, we returned to our room to find Chocolate Covered Strawberries, the lights and bed turned down and a Barry Manilow romantic CD playing in the Bose sound system. My wife freaked... a note accompanied the CD indicating that it was a gift to help us remember our visit with them.... are you kidding me.

New York, Central Park, Ritz Carlton... your going to pay, but who cares? This hotel and this staff have no rivals if it is an exceedingly memorable visit to New York you desire. If you're just looking for a cheap bed, this is not your place.

Highlights are the Location, Central Park, Staff, The club lounge.
Like all in New York, the rooms are relatively small, but better than most. The hotel is old, but fresh.

One of the top properties in the US. Bar none.

5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 1, 2012 NEW

I am writing to let you know how pleasant our stay at The Elan was at a most unpleasant time in our lives. My husband and I checked into the hotel May 13 and were greeted by the desk clerk (from New Orleans). The following morning he had open heart surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm. That surgery was a huge success but he had a stroke that wasn't detected until the next day. A friend stayed with me until my mother arrived from Dallas on Wednesday morning. I can't begin to tell you how great it was for us to de-stress once we returned from Cedars-Sinai in the evenings. The side table lamps were lighted, soft music playing, and chocolates. The "Wishing You Sweet Dreams", with the weather forecast for the next day, was not only a nice touch, but very helpful~ especially because it included the temps.

There were so many big and little things that made this an exceptional boutique hotel. Any time we had a question, Michael Kim seemed to be the person we talked with on the phone. At one point I was having difficulty getting online and he suggested that I bring my laptop to the desk. I took it down there and he got me right on line. All of the staff seemed genuinely friendly~ not forced and Michael especially friendly and helpful.

At one point I was having trouble getting a signal on my cell and got the strongest next to the window. I couldn't help but notice that the sill was spotless and the rest of the room was very clean, too.

The bathroom was great with room under the sink for the bags of toiletries and the lemon grass scented toiletries you provide were
good but the soap was so unique and made such good sense!!! The little touches like the shoe cloth and Kleenex fan folded, were things that take time for the housekeepers but add to the over-all feel of the caring to detail that the hotel has done so well. The outstanding things were the robe and towels~ the weight was the best ever! They were thick enough to be very absorbent but not so weighty~ especially the robe! They were "green" also as I'm sure they don't take as long to dry.

The breakfast had a nice selection and we enjoyed the coffee~ both in the room and with breakfast. The casual seating and places to eat were comfortable. We didn't use the mini bar but the list looked like there were lots of choices if you need to use that.

You probably wonder if I stay at many hotels, but I have in the past and my mother, who constantly travels both domestically and internationally, thought your hotel was exceptional. She made out the comment folder and was disappointed there wasn't more comment space to rave about the hotel.

If your health allows, Cedars is a quick walk, if not, a short cab. Staff gets it. You (or someone w/you) is so sick that they are in LA and visiting Cedars and not Disneyland. One is treated kindly and the evening wine is a relief. Get some breakfast in the morning (unless you are NPO and if so, sorry). It is simple and fresh and lordy, odds are you have big day ahead. Rooms are small. Bed and bathroom are decent, nice design and have all the basics. If you feel a burst, trot over to Marshall's - great buys. And there is also a CVS just down the way to get those new RXs filled - 24hrs! I like these Elan folks, they handled the rabid patient (me) and the stressed family with gentle consideration. Thank you.

I already knew the neighborhood well, and it is a great one for seeing Hollywood, Weho, and pretty much anything you'd want in LA. The staff was nice and seemed helpful, although again I didn't really need info or anything from them so my contact was minimal. My issue with the hotel is simply that actual bed etc seemed barely over motel class. There was nothing particularly wrong with it, It just wasn't wasn't luxe by any stretch of the imagination. Bed was very hard, pillows were flat, linens were scratchy. The room was very warm, and although there was an outside "balcony" it was on street level facing a run-down apartment building and wasn't exactly enticing. At the time I stayed there was no onsite restaurant or bar so after a long day of shooting, relaxing in the evening and having a drink at the hotel was not possible. I think I paid just under $200 per night for the room, which frankly didn't seem worth it, especially compared to other hotels in LA at the same price point that had more to offer. Most likely I won't stay again.

Needed a place close to Cedars Sinai Hospital and thanks to their discount for hospital visitors, it made it affordable, especially in this area. I also really liked that they had valet parking. My other hotel choices were street parking or a parking structure, so here I felt safe arriving back late at night.

Service was great, and the staff even made sure I had a glass of wine upon my late night arrivals. I couldn't make the wine and cheese hour due to my visits at the hospital. Rooms were clean, lots of pillows and good size bath towels. Loved the water pressure in the shower. It was perfect.

My only "complaint" was that the sheets on the bed aren't pulled close enough to the top. I'm average height, but had to burrow down to feel like I was covered; then, my feet were at the edge of the bed. I sleep in super soft bed at home, and I didn't find the firmness of these beds too harsh.

Complimentary wi-fi is awesome, plus they have 3 computers with a printer downstairs in the lobby area.

I recently stayed for 5 days, post surgery at a NY hospital. (I am from CA). My apartment had a full kitchen, bedroom, livingroom with a pull out bed for my niece, and access to a terrace. There was plenty of room for me to get moving with crutches, and I did not feel like I was in confinement. The staff were very kind. The apt was kept very clean. There were two drawbacks, one which would not matter for most tourist or business travelers. The first, there is some interesting thumping noises that go on during the day. there were times when I fell asleep without earplugs that it woke me, however, not a big deal. The other was the shower. The water pressure was ok, but the temp was weird. The first day it was hot or scalding. Maint. came up and got it adjusted for me, and it was fine the next day. The third day, it was back to hot and scalding. Overall very minor complaints.
Overall I would reccomend this propert, the minor quirks are far outweighed by price, cleanliness, and proximity to all kinds of things.

All of the staff were friendly and helpful, especially Sam the Man, and the delightful Mayran who manages the breakfast room. Yes, the breakfast room can be a little tight during busy periods, but we sometimes used the quaint outdoor patio which was secluded and tranquil. We never had the need to take a breakfast tray back to our room. The freshly-made waffles were a real treat, as were the munchkin donuts!

BWHH is one of the most comfortable, friendly and well-located places that I have ever stayed.

When I tell you that customer service is not dead, I mean it with this hotel. I was in town from Chicago for the weekend attending my father's graduation. At the minute, the hotel I had booked for my parents as a graduation gift fell through and the hotel I was in was fully booked. My husband and I happened upon the hotel accidentally and decided to see if it was a good place for my parents to stay. I am very picky especially when it comes to my parents. Inside the hotel, I encountered SAM (the manager). When I say amazing personality, I am not lying folks. This man went WAY out for me and my parents. Aside from the great customer service, the hotel reminded me of a beautiful New York apartment. It was gorgeous and spacious. My parents could not stop talking about how much they enjoyed their stay. When I return to the city where will I be staying??? Absolutely, positively here. Thanks Sam!!!

My family of 5 stayed here for 4 days while visiting a college for my daughter. I will say that the hotel exceeded my standards in most categories.

Room: PROS: We got a 1 BR suite. It had a kitchen, 1 BR and a living room with pullout couch. With a family of 5 we had more than enough room to operate and to move about. The place was very clean and updated.The bathroom was good.Kitchen was cleaned and dishes washed each day. Fridge was stocked with complimentary snacks and water. Nice Touch. CONS: The water pressure of the shower was weak. We did not have hot water in the shower for 2 of the 4days. More like luke warm. It was uncomfortably cold. They had to shut of the elevator off for one of the days. Walking up 6 flights stairs after a long day in NYC was not fun, trust me. However, consider that this is an old apartment bldg in NYC. Whaddayawant??

Location: All Pros and no cons. Five stars all around. Walking distance to Times Square and Rock Center. Any kind of food you could want right at your feet. Best Italian food I have ever had is right next door. Pizza Place too. Across the street is a European bakery to die for. On and on. Not to mention the subway is just around the corner to take you wherever you need to go. Felt extremely safe in the area around the hotel. Not a care in the world walking at night with my husband and kids. The location of the hotel is def worth the price of admission.

The hotel: No cons. Five star staff is very friendly, helpful and accomodating to the needs of their guests. The breakfast was delicious. Hot eggs, bacon, juice, best coffee ever, best bagels ever, oatmeal, danish etc. The usual fair.

One other possible con is that when I got home I found dead roach bodies amongst our clothing. We don't and have never had roaches for the past 11 years. I cannot say where they came from. Our suit cases were on the floor of the hotel the whole time but I suppose the pests could have come from anywhere. Also like to mention that I did not physically see any live roaches while in the apartment/suite. I hate to write this, but thought it was important to mention.

Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay with us! Our housekeepers will be very glad to hear you found your apartment clean. It is rare in NYC to have elbow room so we are glad you were able to take advantage of that in our large apartment suite.

We have not had water pressure/temeparature mentioned to us by our guests. I wish I knew while you were here so we could have addressed it for you. I wil have our engineer go run the shower in all the 6th floor two bedrom apartments to see. Our elevator requires some maintence and we try to do that while the guests are out sightseeing midday or if quiet, do the work during the night. It's tough with only one elevator but we try to keep any inconvenience to a minimum.

We use a very reputable nationally recognized service for our extermination and have double the amount the amonunt of service even they recommended as a preventive measure. We have not had any reports of what you mention here. I am sorry that you saw that though and I will have it investigated but as you mention we hope also suspect it came from a cab or airplane.

We hope to see you here again someday soon!! Thank you again!!

We stayed here end April early May 2012, Our room, 2A faced the street so was quite noisy at night, we did however get used to the noise. The 2 bedroomed apartment was a very good size for 5 adults and we weren't crowded at all. Could have dodne with a second bathroom though for that first trip in the morning, five adults wanting to be in there at the same time made for a lot of fidgeting around.

Beds were very comfortable, kitchen was a good size and well equiped. Everywhere was very clean albeit 'shabby'. The chaps on reception were friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. The one problem we had was sorted quickly and without fuss.

Breakfast was tyical breakfast fare, ie- cereal, omlets, sausage, danish, muffins, toast, fruit, yog, waffles. But the breakfast room is very small so I'd say grab the trays from your room go and load up with your breakfast and eat it back in your apartment or if the weather permits there is an outside seating area.

Location was excellent, on E 49th it wasn't far from Times square, Central Park, Top o The Rock and Grand Central Staion. Subways were close by and plenty of places to eat.

We stayed at Radio City Apartments 2 years ago and think that this place is better. We booked it through apartments2book.co.uk so got a very good price. Beaware though that it is very easy to block the toilets, best to 'close the door before all the guests have left' flush and start again if you see what I mean..

Our family of five, including 3 young children, stayed in one of the 2 bedroom apartments. The service provided by Sam and the rest of the team was outstanding, even housekeeping was happy to return later in the day to accommodate sleeping jet-lagged children. The facilities were first rate - full size fridge, all appliances in order except for the dishwasher which was promptly replaced while we were there - and the apartment had plenty of room, particularly given the price. One very handy thing was that each of the 2 bedrooms as well as the living area had a TV, which meant that even though one of the kids was asleep on the sofa bed in the lounge room, it didn't mean lights out and quiet time for everyone else. Only drawback to mention is that the street noise can be a bit much from time to time but all of us slept very well nonetheless and what can you expect for such a central midtown location? We have had several vacations to New York and stayed in a variety of places in Manhattan, but I think we've found the place we'll be returning to each time from now on in.

My wife and I stayed here twice when showing family members the city for the first time. When we come as a couple, we choose quieter neighborhoods, but this is a perfect location for first-timers, especially with children and teenagers.

Both times we got a suite so grandchildren could join us in our room. The first suite was larger with bathroom access from both rooms, but the more recent one was smaller with bathroom access only in the main bedroom. Even so, it worked, and there was privacy for both rooms when desired.

The street outside the hotel is as crowded and noisy as can be, but the hotel itself is very quiet. We were on the 34th floor this time; there are four elevators and they are fast and efficient. The rooms are well equipped and the service is good. We paid extra for Wi-Fi this time. A friend once told me, "You don't come to New York to save money!" Words of wisdom.

Some tips: We bought unlimited 7-day passes for the MTA ($29) and were glad we did. We ate at Ellen's Stardust Diner both times; a fun intro to NYC for children/teenagers. Also, we take them to Lombardi's for pizza and Rice to Riches for desert. Both are wonderful and unique to NYC. We love Junior's (Times Square) for after theater dining. The Staten Island Ferry is a great (free) way to see the Statue of Liberty, and there is a very moving 9-11 Memorial on Staten Island near the ferry. Second Ave Deli is wonderful for a kosher deli experience. By planning ahead with some online research, we have seen the top three Tony nominated Broadway shows (Book of Mormon last year; Death of a Salesman and Once this year). Broadway shows are amazing. Also, kids love Madam Tussauds, and so do we. Good FREE things to do (other than Staten Island) are visit Strawberry Fields in Central Park, walk the Brooklyn bridge (and Brooklyn Heights), visit Washington Square Park, walk the High Line park, see Rockefeller Center, see Grand Central Station, and walk through Chinatown. Our teenage grandson, who plays the drums, was wowed by the show we saw at the Blue Note (we love this place) and enjoyed the early jazz show we caught at Birdland.

We stayed for four nights in May on an AXON7 award (145K HHonors points) for our daughter's college graduation week - what a wonderful stay! The room was clean and roomy and every single hotel person we interacted with was terrific, from the security men at the hotel entrance to the Cowboy (really!) at the reception desk, to the staff at the restaurant, to the folks cleaning the rooms.
I knew the hotel only provided 2 free breakfasts each day from reading Tripadvisor reviews so when the Cowboy at the front desk confirmed that policy, I told him we would have 4 people in the room and asked whether we could have 4 free breakfasts on two of the days rather than 2 free breakfasts on four of the days. He said it would not be a problem and set it up for us in the computer for the last two mornings of our stay. But wait it gets better! At the first breakfast, my wife talked with Hannah, the hostess at the restaurant, about some special accomodations we would need the next morning. Not only did Hannah have everything ready and waiting at breakfast the next day, but she also addressed us by name as soon as she saw us! Hannah really went out of her way to make sure we felt special and were well taken care of - thank you Hannah!
Overall, a fantastic stay - we highly recommend this hotel for a family stay in NYC!

'A Great Experience with a 10 year old'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 2, 2012 NEW

For a tourist in New York the Double Tree Suites is a perfect location. We had our 10 year old granddaughter with us and she loved Times Square. With or without a child, Times Square is a great experience. The hotel is located right next to the subway entrance and close to Penn Station so transportation is easy. The hop on, hop off bus pickup is just around the corner. The M and M store, Toys R Us with the inside ferris wheel and many other stores and restaurants are within a few blocks. We saw Lion King and it was right across the street.

We were on the 38th floor and it was very quiet. I recommend requesting a high floor as Times Square, honking cars and sirens are noisy.

We had a room with 2 double beds and sofa bed in the living room area. Our granddaughter slept in the bedroom with us which was nice because we could watch TV in the living room when she went to bed and my husband was able to get up in the morning, make coffee and read the paper without disturbing us. Most hotel rooms in New York are very small but these were not. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.



My husband is a Hilton diamond member and our breakfast buffet was free but we did have to pay for our granddaughter. If you have to pay the breakfast buffet it is over priced.

Our refrigerator wasn't working and the repairman didn't come up until several hours later. We didn't wait for him. When he did get there he apologized for taking so long and compensated us by not charging for our granddaughters breakfast the following to mornings which was very nice of him.

Our three week US vacation started with Big Apple. While the taxi driver knew the place, I could not see it from distance. Rather when he stopped in front of hotel on 7th avenue, I started worried. A bell boy came quickly to the cab, took over the luggage working with cab driver, mentioned the pieces number and gave us a receipt. He followed us in. Granted the receiving lobby on first floor or for that reason on third floor is not fancy. The quick check-in, warm cookies, and friendly reception makes it up for that. We had a 36flr conference suite. It had a view of central park and times square. Being on 36th for meant no noise issues. Window cover took care of flashing light nicely.

As locations go, this turned out to be an excellent location around times square, with
1. Train stops just in front of the hotel for times square/42nd st stop- a multi route junction. (liberty statue- battery park, Chinatown-canal street, museum of natural history- 76th st, empire state building - 34th st all accessible through this. Just buy a 50$ metro card for a family of 4 for 3 nights stay.)
2. Broadway, off-broadway theaters are few blocks around this location and 50% discount broadway show ticket booths are literally in front, facing 47th st., and
3. Food places around are so many and nearby, including the soup nazi, Stage Deli, Ray's Pizza.
With these many choices, we had chosen not to do b'fast in hotel.

Central park, Columbus Circle, Rockfeller Center and Radio City are at walking distance.
We appreciated that doubletree provides Guest Suite - that are clean, well furnished (kitchenette, bathrooms, lots of towels and toilettories and unlimited warm cookies at front door - a very smart move as at this location that all we wanted from the hotel!

Very busy week in NYC with the fleet and Memorial Day but well managed by the hotel. Have stayed here several times before and it was better than I remembered. Good exercise room. Convenient to everything. Nothing truly amazing but a very comfortable stay with only one disappointment experienced by my wife. The refrigerator was not working and we lost $50 of food from a steak house and a sushi bar. It took all day to get it working and she lost the only sunny day waiting in the room for the repair man. Staff tried to recover and provided several options which we accepted with satisfaction.

A tip for those who have never been to the hotel before, the hotel is actually on the corner of 7th Avenue at 47th St NOT Broadway/47th despite the address being listed on Broadway. However, after a phone call to the hotel and a quick loop around the block I got to the right spot and checked in. As a Hilton Honors Diamond member I got upgraded to a Pure Suite with very nice amenities and promptly collapsed on the bed and went to sleep. Bed and linens were very comfy and high quality. Room was facing Times Square, but the drapes totally blocked out all light and it did not distract my sleep at all. Wake up call at 8 am, and I was up and at 'em. Shower needed a little maintenance as the water was weak coming out of the shower head and water was gushing out of the faucet resulting in a lot of standing water in the tub while I was showering. Not a big deal. Went to Ginger's for breakfast, nice buffet, plenty of variety, service in the restaurant was non-existent. Nobody ever came after I was seated to pour coffee or offer beverages. Finished my plate, grabbed my things, and off to work. Would definitely stay there again, but a couple of tweaks could turn this place from good to great.

Double Tree Hilton
We stayed here based on the main reason we are a family of 5 (2 adults 3 children 16,13,10) and these suites could fit us all in at a reasonable price, in an amazing location.
We arrived at 1am and my 10 year old son asked if he could wear his sunglasses as it was so bright in Times Square! The hotel lobby was secure and we were greeted by a security guard who explained that check inn was on the next floor. The staff member on duty was not particularly friendly and did not offer the children any cookies but it was 1am.
Our room as we had requested was on a high floor we were actually on the top floor (away from any traffic noise). The room was basic but clean with a handy kitchenette.
We had booked our New York Trip to celebrate my 40th Birthday and although the hotel new this there was nothing to acknowledge this special event, this was very disappointing as a message or a card on the TV would have sufficed.
The concierge were very helpful , and able to get tickets for a sold out Knicks game for us at Madison Square Garden, we were very pleased and grateful.
Overall great for the location average hotel experience.

'Excellent Property in "Times Square"...Sort Of'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed June 6, 2012 NEW

We just returned from a long weekend in New York City and stayed at this property. As hotels in NYC go, this is an excellent property. Our room was bigger than most you find in Manhattan (king room) and came equipped with a flat panel television with an excellent choice of stations, complimentary coffee, a desk, overpriced snacks and a mini bar. The bathroom was modern and spacious and the linens were of high quality. Overall, the room was very clean, no bugs, and the street noise from 44th street was minimal.

As for calling this property as a "times square" location, that's a bit of a stretch. The hotel is located at the corner of 44th Street and 8th Avenue, which is about two blocks west of the traditional Times Square location that's become a fixture in the minds of travelers and where the annual New Year's Eve celebration takes place. With that said, it's location might actually be more of an attraction for some of you since it's quieter than being in the "heart" of Times Square. Plus, it's a short five minute walk to all the action.

BEWARE: I booked the reservation through Hotwire and was able to save about $120 a night off the regular rate. However, the Hotwire rate is basically for a "run of room" reservation, meaning you get what they offer you. When I checked in, they offered us a room with two full beds. That wasn't going to work for my wife, daughter and I. They ended up offering us a king room upgrade (complimentary), which we took, but then charged us $30 a night for a rollaway bed. We still saved money in the long run. However, I would check the hotel's website and compare their rates with Hotwire. If comparable, book through the hotel so you know exactly why you're getting. If you are a solo traveler or someone traveling with your spouse, go the Hotwire/Priceline route.

Would I stay here again? Absolutely. The location was great, the staff was accommodating and our weekend was a lot of fun. But it's NYC, so be prepared to open your wallet often!

Hilton wasn't bad, but lobby was on a high floor, but had a large area for sitting, working and hanging out. Main entrance was under construction so one entered on 41st St. W Union Square was nice, but room not as much light as the other two and also didn't have as good views although it was in a great location. the W was normally more expensive, but I had a discount local rate through work. W's bar area is neat, but also sort of small. For the money at hotels normal rates, the Intercontinental was the best value.

When we arrived at the hotel we received a warm welcome and asked if there were any opportunties to be on the highest floor we could - the Reservations attendent was great, understood how excited we were and bumped us up.
The room was so comfortable, everybody raves about the beds on TripAdviser and they were so right, expect to find it hard to get out of them! The rooms were serviced impeccably each day - remember to drop housekeeping a tip every couple of days and get extra special treatment!
The in-room dining was wonderful, attention to detail and no different to what you would expect if you were sitting downstairs in the restaurant which was also a fantastic intimate atmosphere, expecially at night!
The bellboys are fantastic and the doorman so helpful in getting a cab or simply taking your shopping upstairs so you can continue on your way!
Adrian and Sonia at the conceirge desk were unbelievably friendly, helpful and full of ideas. I called them up on a clear day whilst on the bus and asked if they could organise my friend and I a helicopter trip for later that afternoon - no problem! Just one example of how helpful they were - not to mention pointing us in the direction of some great bars and restaurants!

The only negative during our trip was the fact that there was no free wifi in the hotel and $15/day is pretty expensive on what are not cheap rooms... perhaps something to think about, but NYC is full of free wifi - almost every coffeshop, restaurant has it!

Thanks Intercontinental Times Square for your contribution to an amazing holiday!

The hotel was very clean and spacious. We got to experience the wine tasting our last day and it was relaxing before are journey back home. We felt like royalty by the way the staff was so accommodating. I would stay here again and will chose other Kimptom hotels for my future girls getaways

The entire staff was professional, friendly and accommodating. I asked for early check-in and once my room was ready, they seeked me out in the den area. Check- in and check-out was quick and uncomplicated.
I had a corner city-view room. It was very large compared to other NYC hotels that i have stayed at. And it was impeccably clean.
The food at the Print restaurant was amazing, as was the service. The roof top lounge, The Press, offers breath taking city views in a living room type atmosphere.
I definitely plan on staying here on future trips to NYC.

We stayed in the Hudson River Suite that had an amazing view over the Hudson River (Funny that!)

The room was generously large and had high quality furniture and fittings throughout. We would almost call it a home away from home.

Whilst we did not dine in the hotel restaurant we regularly had drinks on the roof top bar and enjoyed the magnificent views. I would like to point out to management though that it was somewhat disappointing we could not charge back our drinks from the bar back to the room. Therefore had to head back to the room. Just a minor point but put us out a little as we had to get the lift to ground floor then to the room, then to the ground floor, then back to the bar. Yes you read it right! Apparently this is some "security" measure but just made no sense. After this we made sure we took cash to the bar!

We enjoyed the nightly drinks that the Kimpton are renowned for too!

Location wise was very good with times square only a 10-15 minute walk and Hells kitchen only about 5 minutes down the road for all the dining options you could imagine.

Overall a pleasant stay and would certainly stay again! This was our first stay at a Kimpton and we will surely try other properties in their group when we return back to the US

The front desk is staffed with very friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable people, well-equipped to respond to all questions. They know spots around the city the average tourist wouldn't find most likely, and they are eager to help solve any problems which might arise. They get high marks, definitely. The rooms are more spacious that your average NYC hotel, possibly because the hotel is located in a rehabilitated printing factory a block off the Hudson River at 47th and 11th. Not right in the middle of things but an easy walk to almost anywhere, if you like to walk, which we do. Our city view room included a small sitting area, perfect for having a drink before going to dinner, although the hotel hosts its own complimentary happy hour from 5 to 6, where they serve wine, which included a very nice sangria while we stayed. An added treat is the coffee/tea service in the morning, and icy cold water or lemonade available in the lobby during the day. There is a wonderful bar, The Press, on the rooftop with amazing views in all directions. Try to visit during the day and at night, as it looks entirely different. Be warned that much of the seating LOOKS very cool, but is terribly uncomfortable. The restaurant off the lobby, Print, has amazing food but is not a Kimpton restaurant, as we were told several times. It didn't matter to us. The food was an inventive combination of fresh-sourced ingredients, and we rate Print a don't miss feature of staying at Ink 48. Become a Kimpton In Touch member, and not only do you earn credit for a future free night, but the wii-fi is free, and you get a mini bar coupon. It's no wonder why we loved Ink 48, and were sorry to say good-bye

The staff was extremely helpful, friendly, and accomodating. Check-in was fast, smooth, and easy. A bottle of champagne was delivered shortly after we checked in! They have a wine reception every evening which we only caught once as we were so busy, but it was a delicious summer sangria. I didn't noticed any unnecessary noise, even though there is a rooftop lounge. There are no ice machines, but whenever we needed ice, it was delivered to our room within minutes. They are pet-friendly, so if that bothers you, you may want to go elsewhere as there were several dogs there. My only slight complaint is that the hotel is a little far away from where most of the action is. So we started each day with generally a 3 avenue (avenues are long, streets are short) walk before we even got to anywhere we wanted to be. If you don't enjoy a good long walk, either take cabs or stay someplace closer to where you want to be. We kept telling ourselves we were burning off all the delicious food we enjoyed on our trip. Ha ha ha! Given a good deal, we would stay there again based on the great staff alone.

I had stayed there in January and was looking forward to a return visit although I was a little afraid I would be disappointed since I liked it so much the first time. But, to my delight, I loved it just as much the second time. Although a little out of the way (48th and 11th), the hotel is just so nice and welcoming. Everyone is really very nice and helpful. I had an amazing room with a king size bed, a couch and a huge bathroon with a bathtub and a separate shower. I left, once again, looking forward to my next visit.

I would rate this hotel 3.5 stars.

Front Desk: efficient and professional staff. The Staff person rattled off a list of benefits, not sure what all they were. A Better experience would have been to provide me with a check-list of perks.

Non-Front Desk staff: outgoing and fun. I wish the Housekeeping Staff and In-room dining staff would man the Front Desk. In fact, I hope Kimpton encourages individual contributors to cross-train and move up to management.

Decor: Modern. Bed was a comfortable rating of B. The mattresses used at the Arizona Biltmore will always be the best. A shelf ledge on the left against the wall was a bit wobbly.

Internet: ok for email

Clock Radio: correct time was not set. I had to search the net to figure out how to set the time. You had to remove a back cover and press two buttons.

Neighborhood: where UPS has its Manhattan depot. I'm glad I didn't stay near Times Square. A bit of a walk to subway, especially during 80 percent humidity. Would have been nice to offer a free shuttle to the subway.

Nits: I'm getting tired of conservation when it means I can't see my face in the bathroom mirror to shave because there is not enough light. If you want to conserve, go with bright LEDs. TV was ok, no local TV guide provided. Did I see mold in the shower? Or, was it just because it was dark in the bathroom?

Other: I booked my room with Sinqueaway and probably won't do it again. Don't understand why Kimpton has associated itself with such a consumer-unfriendly organization. Didn't know I would not accrue Kimpton Rewards points until I called to confirm my reservation.

Stayed in suite 1410 for 5 nights in May, got a great deal on Travelzoo ($215/night). One bedroom suite was huge, plenty of windows, lighting, closet space, functional bathroom, plenty of outlets, iPod dock, etc. Room could not have been better. Also, breakfast was fantastic - took advantage every morning (croissants were from Balthazar and were to die for!). Couldn't beat the Empire State views from the penthouse rooftop. Staff was friendly enough, and location was fantastic (we were able to walk everywhere).

I would have given this hotel a much better review if it were not for one very concerning problem. On the third day of our stay, we returned to the hotel after a long day (10+ hours) of being out and about to find our hotel door unlocked and ajar. This was presumably the error of careless cleaning staff, and no doubt an accident. This could have been disastrous, as we had our Macbook, iPhones, iPads, plus all of our newly purchased goods in the room. Luckily, nothing was missing from our hotel room.

What was even more concerning was the lack of response or concern from the staff. We called front desk to notify them and received no apology, no offer to send someone up to check things out, make sure no one was in our room or nothing was missing - just an offer to replace our room keys (what good would this do?). Frustrated, we let this go. However, upon checkout, we brought this up again, and this time the front desk staff did seem more concerned. They put a note on file of the incident, and apologized. This made us question why there hadn't been any note or indication made in the first place? Not good, ball had been dropped by staff more than once.

Two weeks later, I have noticed two small charges on my Visa. I have had to call the hotel to inquire what they are for, and received and email response indicating them to be the result of local phone calls placed and items missing from the mini fridge. No phone calls were made (even so, there is not any indication anywhere that there is a charge associated with making local phone calls - this seems quite ridiculous), and I know there was nothing taken from the mini fridge. However, is not worth my time to further challenge these.

Ultimately, my experience at the Morgans could have been much better if it hadn't been for this unfortunate instance and the overall poor response of the staff. We were very lucky that nothing was missing from the room - that could have wrecked our trip. Unless another fantastic deal comes up for this hotel, I probably will not be back.

June 4, 2012
Thank you very much for your review. I do recall this incident - in a small hotel like this, we are normally very aware of everything that goes on. First of all, I am very sorry that you experienced this.

From what I recall, the Front Desk staff told you they were going to conduct a key interrogation. This was done (the interrogation actually records doors opening and closing). The report showed that the Room Attendant actually shut the door because we saw a record of an entry and a departure that corresponded with her paperwork. What we did notice is that the door does not shut completely unless it is pulled shut. Unfortunately, the mechanism was faulty and was fixed. I am very sorry about this.

A word of caution to every guest - these things do happen on occasion in any hotel. It is important that you ensure when you leave the room that the door is completely shut. As you walk away, it may sound like it has shut completely but sometimes it does not. It is by no means your fault, it is up to the hotel to check these things but sometimes it happens during a guest stay. Always check behind you to ensure that your door locks properly. If it does not, please let Management know.

Kind regards,

DR

Our Loft room and bathroom was impressivly large and tastefully decorated. Beds comfortable and above all, everything was super clean. Although this is an older building, the facility has been updated. After a day out exploring the city & visiting with family, coming back to the hotel felt like coming home to one's own apartment on Madison Avenue. The breakfast was a welcome surprise as was the lovely breakfast room itself. I can't say enough about the staff - they were always helpful, friendly & treated us as welcomed guests. Valet parking was convenient & well priced. The location is also great. We have family in NYC and we will definately be back to the Morgan. Loved it!

the bed was super comfy, i wanted to take it home with me. we had a 2 room suite, it was ok..lots of comfy pillows.

the free breakfast was nice as it ended at noon, not at 10 am like other hotels.....we never make it to those as who wants to get out of bed that early for a bagel?? it was the basics, creeal, fruit, pastrys...they were pretty bland though.

but seriously, when you cant figure out how to work the lights in the bathroom when youre sober, its too difficult. too confusing...just give me a switch!!


all in all it was a ok place, the staff was friendly.

We get our pastries from Balthazar - one of the finest places in the city so I am surprised you found them bland.

Really, you do not need a PhD to work the lights - something that I always do when arriving at a new hotel is to ask for a Bellman whether I have lots of luggage or not. I find it is so helpful to get a 'room orientation'. I often fumble with lights and thermostats myself so it is always good to get a little tour!

Hope you have a great summer!

Our room was lovely and spacious by NY standards and the beds so comfy it was hard to get up in the morning! The continental breakfast was a real bonus as was the lounge on the first floor which meant we could have a nice cup of tea whilst setting up and using our newly purchased iPads. My only slight criticism would be the lack of lighting in the room - we were on the 12th floor overlooking the street but the room was still a little dark. Would definitely stay here again.

'Unforgettable Stay at Trump Towers'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed June 5, 2012 NEW

We just returned from three nights at Trump Towers to celebrate my Nephew's eleventh birthday and are still basking in the "afterglow".
Our upgraded corner room had a wonderful view of Columbus Circle where 7th Ave. and Broadway converge as well as a good view of Central Park.
The staff was as welcoming and gracious as you would expect at a hotel that is in the Trump group. Nothing was too much trouble and they always had a welcoming smile each time you returned to your "New York home away from home".
Our Nephew couldn't have been more pleased. He even slept with the shades up so that he could enjoy the ambiance of New York's neon wonderland.
When we arrived, we had a significant snafu at the airport and needed to re-print all of our documentation for the trip. The front desk took care of the problem with professional courtesy and efficiently delivered a computer to our room since the Business Center was closed at that late hour. All of our missing documents were printed and waiting for us early the next morning (including tickets to the theatre, the Empire State Building, 911 Memorial, dinner reservations, etc.).
Thank you Kristin!
I am not sure why there are negative comments regarding the size and configuration of the bathroom. We found it to be lovely and very well equipped (spa tub, lighted makeup mirror, extra huge towels, wonderful toiletries, etc.).
Perhaps the only negative (and this is really nit-picking) was that the half bath lighting was quite dim, making it difficult for make up application. There, I did find a negative as you always can if you are a pessimist!
The location, service and staff make Trump International Hotel and Tower my first choice on any future visits to New York.
Again, thank you for all of your courtesy. You gave my Nephew a lifetime memory of our time in New York that will live long after we are gone from his life.

Just finished a 7 night stay at the Trump international and wish I was still there!! We stayed in a 1 bedroom executive city view suite which was gorgeous. Ceiling to floor windows with views down Columbus circle which we loved. I know central park is beautiful, but in my opinion you can get beautiful green views in any place so not worth extra, the city view was very iconic NYC to me. After hectic days of site-seeing we couldn't wait to get back to our calm oasis of a suite to watch a film on the mammoth TV (it was HUGE and there were 2!)

The kitchen was really useful as we didn't want to eat out at restaurants for so many nights so we just popped over to Whole Foods and it even had a freezer so were able to keep a stash of take-home Pinkberry (one round the corner!)! Other good things: great subway lines next door, perfect location, easy for cabs.

Like other reviews, there really are only a couple of downsides. The bathroom is very average and with the space available, not really sure what they could do to improve. It was also not very soundproof. We went down to check out the pool and it was only OK, but I guess good for NYC standards. Don't let bad comments about the bathroom turn you off though, the rest of the room more than makes up for it and it's still nice enough. And finally, it goes without saying that a downside is the cost, but worth it if you can afford it.

A fantastic hotel, you won't regret!

I booked Trump just for one reason - to watch Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and to have an opportunity to watch it from your room. We moved to Trump from a different hotel so I could do an immediate comparison. Reservation was done well and special thank to a reservation manager who took care of all our needs.

The location is superb - we were overlooking Central park and the view was breathtaking. Arrival was quite clumsy, I did not feel like a welcome guest to be honest. Check-in went smoothly though (well I paid in advance anyway). Our begs arrived before us as the other hotel we were staying at took care of everything for us and transferred all our luggage to Trump. The guy who took our begs up was not very friendly and I had a feeling that he was looking at us like at some "Europeans who do not know how to tip so why to care much". Staff overall is quite friendly and helpful.

Our room was way too small for 1200 USD per day I was paying. My fault I guess not to look for something bigger. We liked a fact of having a full kitchen as our son likes when we cook something rather then eating at different places all the time. The gold plating, the marble, Trump's face on the water bottle and vodka's bottle....I am afraid this is way too much.

In-room dining was absolutely fabulous. Excellent food, great service. I can not fault it. We did not have a chance to eat at the hotel restaurant or to have breakfast, but I heard that food is excellent.

Housekeeping needs serious improvement. I expect some better one at the hotel claiming to be 5 star (I guess everyone can put it on front sign nowadays).

I would have no problems staying at Trump again, but only if there are no rooms available at 2 other hotels we visited during our stay in NYC. I would still recommend it to my friends traveling without children and for short stays only if they want to stay next to Central Park or if they go for business.

First, the location is superb - overlooking central park and steps from the Columbus Ave subway hub. Staff quickly recognizes the guests and is quite friendly and helpful, giving the impression that it is an intimate place. I booked a jr. suite with park view via amex platinum -- sadly, no "upgrade upon arrival" (unusual, but I guess, none was available). The room was a bit quirky with two long, slender interconnected rooms and the layout detracted from the ambiance. Still, the bed was excellent, views superb. There was a full kitchen, a second bath and enough closet space to store a moose. I did, however, get a bit tired of seeing The Donald's name and face everywhere.

I ordered a birthday cake, vintage champagne and roses (it was a celebration) less than 24 hours before check-in. All were spectacular and the champagne was iced to coincide with the timing of my arrival (nice touch - I've found it sitting in melted ice water at other hotels).

Parking is a challenge at the Trump, as it's off to the side and one needs bread crumbs and a road map to find the back door into the hotel (it shouldn't be this hard - all that's needed is a sign!). For those who religiously avoid hotel restaurants, Jean George is one of the country's top tables (and priced accordingly, but well worth the expense - especially if you're a foodie. I wouldn't recommend a quick meal - dinners here are to be savored (Book well in advance, though). While the restaurant might be a tad too extravagant for some, the adjoining lounge serves excellent food in a more relaxed, albeit very noisy, space. The lounge, however, may be a bit too "happening" for those who prefer a quieter meal. Strangely, with such a pedigree for the dining room, I found breakfasts here to be OK, but nothing special.

Overall it's very nice hotel and I'd stay again. It's a good value (especially when compared to the nearby Mandarin). It's a toss up with the Tower rooms at the NY Palace (my other go-to hotel in NYC) for the price. The Palace Towers offers a better location for theater and shopping, rooms have a bit more feng shui, and the executive lounge is convenient, albeit typically quite crowded. On the other hand, the intimacy, views and service at the Trump were terrific - so either will be a good choice.

However this hotel screams 70's left right and centre. The building itself seems to have been dipped in a pool of chocolate - brown everywhere. And then the gold plating, the marble, and Trump's own face on the water bottle....come on!

My room was also noisy and could hear traffic down below. Gym & Spa were being refurbushe. Room service options were limited and frankly quite bland. Room for improvement.

Before my husband and I checked in (hotel check in time was a very late 4 pm) I rang and asked if we could leave our luggage and have 2 suits, an evening gown and a tuxedo pressed before actually checking in AND have ALL items returned by 6 pm on the same night. They said it wouldn't be a problem.

After dropping everything off at 11am I went off shopping and rather than carting my purchases about with me I had them delivered to the hotel (bear in mind I had not yet checked in) . By the time I returned to the hotel at 5:30 to check-in all my deliveries had not only arrived but was already placed with all my luggage.

Within 20 minutes of arriving in our room, tea and coffee was delivered and very soon after that all our pressing was delivered and carefully hung up in the large walk-in closet.

Our room was spacious, clean and bright. The view of Columbus Circle and Central Park was perfect.

The only complaint I have is that tea was not served in a teapot but rather in a very North American way of teabag sachet in amongst the sugar packets with a large pot of hot water and cup and saucer. I like my tea to steep before pouring a cup.

During our time here the spa, gym and Jean-George was under renovation so we didn't get to experience any of the 3 however on our previous trip to NYC we did have a wonderful in Jean-George.

Brilliant, friendly service staff, everyone always had a ready smile!

Good Points.

1. Staff are extremely friendly.and service is excellent
2. Restaurant is beautiful - I only had breakfast as a part of a package - but the food was excellent
3. Room was extremely well appointed - I was upgraded to a suite and it was very comfortable

Bad Points

1. Corridors are in need of a refurbishment
2. Spa was closed and therefore I did not get to experience the swimming pool

Wilst the restaurant on site has a bar - there is no bar scene and the hotel is more reminiscent of a very smart apartment block - where you can make best use of neighbourhood bars and restaurants

I would return sine it was very comfortable - but not my favourite

This was our first trip to NY and we couldn't have asked for a nicer place. The location is brilliant - we wanted to stay at a place where Central Park was the doorstep and it's exactly that! The staff are outstanding and the hotel itself is very comfortable. We stayed in a junior suite and whilst I can't complain, the next time I would ask for a central park view. Even though we were on a high floor, the city view is just ok. To have a fantastic 'city view' in NY you really need to be on a floor 20+ up. The hotel's 'attention to detail' is impressive, they really do put in the effort. Bathroom is a tad small but we could deal with that! The one thing this hotel lacks is a 'bar'. It would be nice to come in after a long day out in NY and relax in a bar. The restaurant was closed for renovations when we were there so perhaps they are factoring this into their new space.

I usually stay on the East side but was so happy that I decided to mix things up and stay on the West Side, more specifically Columbus Circle, since I was visiting friends on the upper west side. It is truly an incredible location. The hotel rooms were clean, bright, beautiful and large. It had its own kitchenette, and large windows showing the great expense of central park with the skyline of the East side in the backdrop. You could see all of the carriages lining up to take people for rides. The doorman and check in staff were always friendly and helpful. The Time Warner center, with its shops, offers everything that you may have forgotten or even things that you didn't realize you wanted. The whole foods is convenient if you are staying for awhile and want some snacks, or if you have small children and would like to have some milk for the refrigerator for when they wake up in the middle of the night or don't want to have to travel with baby food. There are several great restaurants just steps away. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

This hotel is wonderful and our stay was great from beginning to end. The desk staff is very professional and helpful. They were always there for us, but were never intrusive. Our check-in was so easy and we were brought complimentary drinks. We had asked for a high floor and we were given the highest floor in the hotel section. The hotel suite was large and beautiful. Everything was high-tech and automated from the blinds, to the drapes to the lighting. The afternoon/evening housekeeper was fantastic and kept our suite spotlessly clean. She would also bring us extra coffee, etc. if we needed it and one day she noticed that I had a cold and she came back and brought me additional tea - she was really wonderful and made our stay even more comfortable. To add to the comfort, there was plenty of closet space to stay for a month and the room stayed dark and quiet, allowing us to sleep late. The fitness center was being renovated when we visited but the makeshift gym was fine for us as the equipment was all new and housed everything that we use. We ate at Jean Georges which is the restaurant in the hotel and it's world class. Leave at least three hours for dinner though as it's a NYC event. I used to live in this area of Manhattan so I especially enjoyed seeing how much the area has changed and improved in the past few years. The only drawback is that the water pressure was extremely weak which made showering and bathing difficult and the bathroom was small in comparison to the size of the suite. Overall we loved this hotel and will stay here again when visiting the Upper West Side.

Just arrived back from our stay at the James Hotel in SoHo.

The majority of the staff at the James are terrific: courteous, friendly and knowledgable. Michael Daniels on breakfast service was particularly professional and took the time to engage with us about our trip. He clearly has a thorough knowledge of New York City and its best venues and locations. The James would possibly make better use of his skills as a concierge (this position seemed to be hot-desked and was hit-and-miss in its quality). This wasn't a major issue for us, though.

The big issue we had with the James was that when it was good it was excellent, but when it was bad, it was diabolical. I have honestly never experienced such a resentful attitude from hotel staff. There were only one or two bad staff members on the James team, but they completely nullify the best efforts of their colleagues. The rest of the James staff have every right to feel cheated and betrayed by this ruinous minority.

The cleaning and room service was shocking. Dirty cups left to pile up, consumables not replenished and the worst possible attitudes. We had to call downstairs EVERY DAY of our stay to tell them things were dirty, missing, not replenished, unfinished etc.

On one occasion, guest services brought two clean cups after we informed the hotel that we had no clean ones as the dirty ones had not been cleared.

When they arrived, we had this little conversation at the door:
Us: "Can you take these two dirty cups for us?"
James Staff (already walking away): "No. You have to call room service for that, I'm a houseman".
The tone of this member of staff's voice was unnecessarily forceful and resentful.

We made a complaint to the manager of the hotel about this, and she was very apologetic about the shortcomings and the rudeness of her staff. She promised us that all of our needs would be catered for the rest of our stay. Unfortunately, the lack of care and attention to detail continued to the point where we became bored of ringing for a breakfast order form and telling them that they hadn't cleared away our breakfast cups and replenished the tea and coffee.

This, in addition to the shower knob missing from our shower and a blocked sink when we arrived (which were quickly and efficiently rectified) only highlighted that more attention should be spent on the housekeeping.

The view from Jimmy's bar is terrific and it's worth going up there before 9pm (before the crowds arrive). But it's not enough to justify a stay at the James.

So, we can't recommend the James and we won't be going back because it's just not worth the risk. Lots of terrific staff (as I stated earlier) like Felix, Christopher, Nicole, Michael Daniels and others. I just feel bad for these people that they have colleagues that are severely jeopardising their hotel's reputation.

Finally, charging $40 for a rollaway bed for one of our five nights, that we never requested may have just been an honest mistake. Check your bill at the end of your stay, just like we checked ours, so you don't pay extra.

It's OK trying to be the coolest hotel in town, but they really need to get the basics right first.

This was our first visit to NYC and after researching and talking to friends we decided to stay in Soho - right choice! The next question was whether to rent an apartment or stay in a hotel. Although I travel a lot I'm not a fan of corporate and chain hotels and usually prefer to look for an apartment or boutique hotel in the place that we are visiting. We settled for The James as the choice in Soho seemed to be limited. What a good decision! The hotel itself is light and bright making up for the rooms being quite small. The bedrooms are comfortable. The restaurant and rooftop bar are spectacular. The interior styling is modern, natural and chic. The staff are the friendliest I have ever experienced - anywhere! Christopher, our doorman deserves a special mention. This gentle giant of a man was a feature of our NY experience. Hands down - highly recommended.

'Cool Rooftop Bar'
4 of 5 stars Reviewed May 18, 2012

Some friends and I went to The Jimmy, the rooftop bar at The James Hotel, for drinks at sunset. What an amazing view! The drinks were pricey but delicious and we figured we were paying for the ambiance. Try the cucumber vodka, it is a special treat. The outside area has a small pool, and I had to wonder how many drunk people had fallen into it over the years. The place is small and it got pretty packed, but it was a nice spot for a couple of drinks. Don't expect to hang out there all night unless you want to drop a lot of dough.

We loved our stay at the James for Valentine's Day Weekend. We were happy that they accept small dogs, and delighted with the dog's bed they provided and a welcome goodie bag that included gourmet truffles for the puppy. The hotel and room design is lovely - clean, simple and modern. Perfectly outfitted mini bar with some of our favorite gourmet drinks and foods. Great selection from artisan, organic to common favorites. Was surprised to find lots of dust in the food tray as I'm all about cleanliness and details, but that was the only unclean aspect of our entire trip. Bathroom amenities were great, although I would have loved a bath tub. Loved the shower gel - wish it was available for purchase. We had a wonderful view from our top floor suite. The room was comfortable and modern enough to entertain a few friends. Favorite spot was the rooftop bar. Perfect for cold weather, as you don't have to go outside to be in one of the coolest spaces in town with delicious food, drinks and 360 views of the city. Perfect place to have your friends visit with you while you're in town. My NYC friends enjoyed the space and I enjoyed not needing to get out into the freezing weather. Food in the hotel overall was pretty good. I loved the late night spaghetti, while our breakfast in bed was just good. Juices at the restaurant were delicious. I highly recommend going to the Soho Grand for brunch - delicious arugula salad and lovely space. The only bad experience with the James was our cab driver telling us how the door boy demanded a payment from him in order to tell us that he is available, if the driver didn't pay him he would have lied to us that the driver was busy - really uncool as on top of that we tipped the door boy, so he ended up with extra $30 for being shady... Other than that, I will definitely stay at the James on my next NYC trip. Perfect location, close to great restaurants, shopping, galleries, etc. Love the modern, urban feel of it.

The David Burke restaurant is amazing and packed for lunch and dinner in their indoor and lovely outdoor spaces! The rooftop bar and pool have terrific views and are rocking in the evenings!the lobby lounge is a great place to meet friends,browse ,sip wine and have a bite (complimentary).The staff are charming and extremely friendly! The doormen enthusiastic and will hail a taxi at any time.forget pre booking a cab for the airport,they can be found easily in the area for half the price! Newark is just 25 mins away on a good day! Fashionable shopping and restaurants within walkable distance and Subway access is close by.
The local crowd that uses the hotel is trendy but the guests themselves are very eclectic! A very non intimidating yet sophisticated and contemporary hotel with tons of light and energy!

3 of 5 stars Reviewed April 29, 2012

I know my title may sound strange but I really believe if she did, it would truly be a notch above so many other hotels because of her attention to detail and customer service skills. I don't want to give this hotel a negative review, I wanted to like it as much as Margaret in reservations. It is certainly not a bad hotel, but it has the potential to be a wonderful hotel. In defense of the hotel, since I only stayed for one night, maybe I caught it on an "off" day. I was coming to town for a Dr's appt and because I was so sick I needed my mother and her husband to drive me. I had changed my reservation 3 times because my migraine was so bad and Margaret was very accommodating. The day of my arrival I called to add a room to my reservation. The rooms were around $750 and I was eligible for an upgrade because I am an Andrew Harper member. Margaret made the smart suggestion that I upgrade my room for a couple hundred of dollars and then use the upgrade, and add on my parents room making it a two bedroom suite. I thanked her for even thinking that up and was so excited about my stay. The Andrew Harper rewards also entitled us to a bottle of wine, vip fruit basket, free afternoon tea and a continental breakfast. When we arrived, around 3:30, they said the room wasn't ready and I thought, oh perfect we can go for tea, but we were told to wait in the waiting area, which we did. After about 45 minutes we were taken to our room. The living room was great, it was comfortable, newly re-finished, it had a terrace with a really interesting city view, if you hung over the balcony enough, you could even see central park. I took the nicer bedroom, it had the same city view, a gorgeous bathroom with great amenities. The carpet however was wet from being cleaned and had that weird chemical smell, if I didn't have a migraine, it would have been more livable for me. The other bedroom was also nice, city view, but not as good as mine and it had a much smaller bathroom. But again, we were only there for one night. We had room service for dinner and we were told that it would take approximately 45 minutes, it ended up closer to an hr and 45 minutes. I hate confrontation, so does my mother, but my stepfather yelled at room service which embarrassed me greatly, they took care of the bill which I thought was more than generous (maybe it was part, I really stayed out of the whole thing, I hid in my bedroom). The food was amazing, we had this awesome tomato soup, although it would have been better if it came with the gorgonzola crustini it was advertised with. I had the fresh pea ravioli which was delicious. The VIP fruit basket was 3 apples. No tea. There was no breakfast the following morning. We were also charged a price higher than quoted. Oh, and the lady who did the turn down was lovely I guess to some up.
Pros:
Margaret, Margaret, Margaret....
CIty view suite with terrace
room service

Cons:
Things are just not delivered as promised (I believe this is a customer service issue)
We were charged a price higher than we were quoted

Honestly, I wouldn't stay here again because I don't know what it would be like, this is my only experience with this hotel. It was overall just more disappointing than anything, it would have been better to expect nothing and be surprised along the way.

Thank you for your review and for the kind words about our reservation manager Margaret and for the housekeeping attendant who performed turndown service in your room.

We apologize that you were not able to go to the Pembroke Room while you were waiting, as well as for the delay for your room service order.

As a member of Andrew Harper you are entitled to complimentary continental breakfast daily as well as complimentary afternoon tea for two once during your stay.

When you walk down the steps from 63rd Street to the Lowell's small lobby you feel as if you're coming home from the storm of the city. The desk people are welcoming, the concierge is knowledgeable and "wired," the doorman and porters greet you pleasantly. When you get to your suite, assuming you have treated yourself to one, you wonder if you'd just as soon stay for a loong while. We've been coming to the Lowell for a few decades, and the place has maintained a delightfully high level of service all that time. The rooms have been refurbished more than once during that period. The latest do-over was A+ with respect to the bathroom in our last suite -- a very worldly friend commented, on seeing the bathroom, "I want a bathroom just like this!" Our bed had about 10 pillows on it, making choosing just the right one a snap. Usually higher rooms are hotter (hot air rises, after all) but to our delight our suite on the 14th floor was not unpleasantly warm. The hotel only has two tiny elevators, one of which is not infrequently out of service, which is inconvenient, but the only fly I can identify in this particular ointment -- or, rather, balm.

I believe we've been staying at the Lowell for approximately 15 years, usually visiting in the spring and fall. My wife and I have a favorite one-bedroom suite that we request, which is particularly nice in cool fall weather with its wood-burning fireplace. The suite has been totally renovated with a beautiful and spacious white marble bathroom and granite topped kitchenette. We use the Lowell as our base on these 5 night trips for forays to the theater, museums, restaurants and socializing with friends who are lucky enough to call NYC home. The Lowell is a welcome and ultra-comfortable respite from busy days and nights. We have also used it to host small cocktail gatherings in our suite, or order pizza up and watch a movie with friends. As I said, it feels like home and it's a tranquil and inviting respite to busy days and nights in the city. But above all, the real gems of the Lowell are its staff.
These people are there to serve in a friendly and professional manner. They're down to earth, but exacting in executing your wishes and making you feel welcome and very special. From desk managers, to doormen, to bell men, to waiters and housekeeping, we see very little turnover from year to year. I assume the Lowell personnel are treated well, enjoy their jobs, and therefore reciprocate to their guests. The concierges, John Mark and Philip, are outstanding resources, well connected, and eager to advise and facilitate. The Lowell is a small hotel with approximately 4 rooms or suites per floor on 17 floors. It is an old building, but gracious and elegant. If you enjoy your hotels large, sleek, and bustling, this isn't what you're looking for. If you want highly personal attention, elegantly timeless ambience, and a stellar east side location between Park and Madison, this is your place. However, like most things dear and unique, it comes at a price, and it will get your attention depending on what type of accommodation you
choose. But, that is a matter of choice, personal prioritiy and most likely frame of mind. The Lowell offers my wife and I everything we're looking for in NYC and we always look forward to coming back.

I recently stayed here for the weekend with some girlfriends. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. Everything from the lobby to the room was absolutely amazing. The bellman greeted me before I was even out of the cab and check in was a breeze. The staff were polished, professional and warm. Upon entering the suite, Tony offered to light the fireplace for me.....amazing! I was also offered a beverage of my choice which was complimentary. This hotel is absolutely beautiful....the rooms were like an apartment and were quite cozy and contemporary. It is a great location on the upper east side and easily accessible to all the shopping on Madison Ave. Despite being in the middle of Manhattan, it was unbelievably quiet! I will definitely be back and most definitely recommend to anyone I can!

We stayed in this motel for 3 days, while visiting Venice Beach, Universal etc. We arrived late at night, but the reception is open in the late hours so it was no problem. Before arriving, they responded my emails very quickly and friendly. There were always a parking spot available in front of our room. The bed was soft and the room was comfortable. There were only cups in the kitchen, so we couldn't cook anything. But we had some busy days, so it didn't matter that much.
The price was low and resonable.
Would recommend this motel to others.

'We Felt Like Family!'
5 of 5 stars Reviewed July 21, 2011

When we were planning a weeklong trip to Los Angeles to visit family, our son was put in charge of finding us a place to stay. "You'll love this place," he told us. "I walk past it almost every day. It's a cool little Brazilian boutique motel with a cafe' attached, and it's really inexpensive."

A trip to the motel's website added to our intrigue. Actually -- it seemed a little too good to be true.

But we were not disappointed. Driving into the motel plaza (Note: The driveway is very narrow and is hard to spot from the street.), it felt as if we were being transported to South America -- we found ourselves surrounded by bright colors and flowering plants and quirky SA garden art and festive music.

Our room, while small and basic, also reflected this bright, lively Latin flavor.

Although we didn't spend a great deal of time at the motel, we enjoyed the time we were there -- especially just sitting outside our room at the patio table, enjoying the out-of-doors (not always a given in LA). We also enjoyed time in the adjoining cafe', which features a variety of Brazilian food, LOTS of Brazilian soccer on TV and, interestingly, some very good sake' cocktails (love the sugar-cane stirrers).

Long story short -- we had a great time here, and appreciated the friendliness and graciousness of our hosts. We really felt taken care of in a city that can sometimes feel anonymous and not particularly visitor-friendly. We were told that this little motel is popular lodging for visiting families during holidaytimes, and we can see why.

My apartment complex had flooded and I needed a place to stay for the night. Living near the beach, it can be difficult to find inexpensive lodgings during the late Spring and Summer and just as I suspected, everything in town was booked solid through September. The only options available to me were assorted hotels which were $200+ per night and a handful of motels located a mile or two inward from the shore. I was going to be attending a party that night, so I began looking for something near the party's location. Although I did manage to find a motel just about a half block from my destination, I was a bit dissapointed in it's lack of character. I wanted to stay somewhere that had a more "home-like" feel to it, so I continued to search Google maps for something with a little more "flavor" to it.

..and boy did I find it! And luck of all luck - it was just about 3 blocks away from the area where I would be hanging out that night. PERFECT! I saw a brief orange and fuscia flash across my map. I moused over and all my troubles came to an end. I dragged and dropped my little orange google man down at the address and had a look around. What I saw was a quaint motel painted in vibrant colors attached to a Brasilian restaurant (Cafe Brasil) that I have passed a million times without ever really seeing it. I proceed to the website listed and read the list of amenities: Large Flat Screen TV, Kitchenette, Queen Bed...it all seemed too good to be true. I suspected that there had to be a catch. Something had to be wrong or misrepresented - I was just sure of it.

I called the motel and the woman who answered seemed cheerful and helpful. She informed me that there were only 2 rooms left in this 18 room motel. "First come, first serve", she warned me. I hesitated still suspecting that it was all somehow a trick. "only two rooms left", the words kept echoing in my head. I decided to take a chance and I have never been so pleased with any other split second decision.

Villa Brasil is a quaint motel on Washington Blvd with lovely blooming bougainvillea dangling from the roof and flowing gracefully all across the place. You would never know this little oasis was even there, if you were looking from the street. Once you pull into the complex, there are 18 single story rooms set up in a U shaped courtyard in which every guest is granted a free parking spot. In Los Angeles, that alone is a huge plus when considering any hotel/motel booking. The courtyard is painted in lovely, vibrant shades of orange and each room appears to be named after various birds which are native to Brasil, with a portrait of the bird on the door. In front of each room, there are wooden tables and chairs that are chock full of character. Each table has a lovely candle on it and all of the candles are lit at night, adding to the pleasant motel ambiance. Many of the tables feature "built in" game boards to keep travelers occupied in the event that the large Flat Screen TV's aren't enough. On the night when we were there, we witnessed several tables surrounded by happy, laughing people playing spirited games of chess, checkers and the like. Througout the courtyard there are speakers installed which were playing 1930's-40's blues and swing jazz, on low volume (so as not to disturb the occupants), which really added to the very friendly and homey atmosphere. In fact, it just plain made me happy to hear those wonderful old tunes whenever I stepped outside.

When we first walked into our room, we were instantly greeted by the smell of fresh, clean laundry, which was a big surprise as I was expecting the usual ancient cigarette and smut smell I am accostomed to getting when I first walk into most motels.Inside of our room. The windows were all open, which appears to be common practice there and as far as I'm concerned, it really made a difference to walk into a freshly aired out room. It was so comforting and pleasant. I felt like we hit the jackpot. We found the main wall behind the bed to be covered with a lovely mural which featured a floral theme with happy little bird in the corner. The bed was a queen bed covered in actual "real people" blankets and sheets - not just the standard homogenized white sheets and neutral comforters that most hotels/motels tend to feature. The bed was comfortable enough (although I have slept in more comfortable beds), but the fresh, clean smell of the blankets and sheets was enough to get me past any issues I might have had with the slight lumpiness of the bed. At this point, I am certainly not complaining! There was a small kitchenette which had a bowl of fresh fruit waiting for us along with a coffee maker with free coffee packets, small fridge, a table and 2 bar stools and a sink. There was a small toilet area with a shower and mirror. It was a very basic accomodation, but it had so much personality that I felt like more like I was on vacation in some beautiful foreign place than staying at a motel on a busy highway in Los Angeles. At first I noticed quite a bit of noise coming from the boulevard outside, but after about 10 minutes, the sound somehow just melted away. Our room was somewhat close to the cafe and I was concerned that we might be troubled by restaurant noise, but we never heard a sound coming from that area. I was really amazed.

The only real negative was that whenever our immediate neighbors took a shower, we could hear their water running quite loudly in our room. It is a small price to pay for all the comfort and ambience we found here for the $76 p/n price. Unfortunately, we did not get a chance to eat at the Cafe because it was off business hours when we were there. But we did find a menu posted in our room and the food looks deeeelish! We decided we would be returning to give the restaurant a try very soon. I would highly recommend this sweet little motel to weary travelers passing through who long for a taste of "home".

Villa Brasil is a hidden Gem in the concrete jungle and I'm so glad we found it!

What a find! Talk about location. Close to everything on the Westside. Santa Monica, LAX, Westwood. The price is great. The place is very clean. And the people are friendly. Free Wi-Fi, too. The only drawback is the cost of phone calls...50 cents for the first minute, 10 cents a minute after that. I don't get it!
