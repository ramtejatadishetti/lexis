united states general-accounting-office executive-guide gao october 2001 strategies to manage improper-payments learning from public and private-sector-organizations a gao-02-69g preface the federal government of the united states-the largest and most complex-organization in the world-expended approximately $ 1.8 trillion dollars in fiscal year 2000 . as the steward of taxpayer-dollars , it is accountable for how its agencies and grantees spend those funds , and is responsible for safeguarding against improper payments-payments that should not have been made or that were made for incorrect-amounts . despite the amount of funds involved and the impact-improper payments can have on a program 's ability to achieve its intended outcome , most agencies have not yet estimated the magnitude of improper-payments in their programs . without a systematic measurement of the extent of the problem , agency-management can not determine ( 1 ) if the problem is significant enough to require corrective-action , ( 2 ) how much to costeffectively invest in internal-control-systems to correct the problem , or ( 3 ) the impact of the actions already taken to reduce improper-payments or additional corrective-actions needed . this executive-guide is intended to identify effective-practices and provide case-illustrations and other information for federal-agencies ' consideration when developing-strategies and planning and implementing-actions to manage improper-payments in their programs . it was prepared at the request of senator joseph i. lieberman , chairman , senate committee on governmental affairs . this is one in a series of projects we are undertaking for the senate committee on governmental affairs and the house committee on government-reform concerning the issue of improper-payments involving federal-programs . in producing this guide , we contacted a number of private and public-sector-organizations , which we identified primarily through extensive-research on financial-management-practices , and obtained-information on actions that they took and considered effective in reducing improper-payments . 1the participants were the department of health and human-services ' health care financing administration ; 2the social-security administration ; the department of veterans affairs ; the states of illinois , texas , and kentucky ; the governments of australia , new zealand , and the united kingdom ; and three private-sector-corporations . 3we thank them for their willingness to participate and for the valuable-information and insights they provided . 1 for a more detailed-discussion of our objectives , scope , and methodology , see appendix i . 2 in july 2001 , the health care financing administration was renamed the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) . 3 for a description of each of these entities , see appendix ii . page 1 gao-02-69g improper-payments this executive-guide was prepared under the

introduction observations abbreviations introduction improper-payments are a widespread and significant-problem receiving increased-attention not only in the federal government but also among states , foreign-governments , and private-sector-companies . improper-payments include inadvertent-errors , such as duplicate-payments and miscalculations ; payments for unsupported or inadequately supported-claims ; payments for services not rendered ; payments to ineligible-beneficiaries ; and payments resulting from outright-fraud and abuse by program-participants and/or federal-employees . in the federal government , for example , they occur in a variety of programs and activities , including those related to contractors and contract-management ; health-care-programs , such as medicare and medicaid ; financial-assistance-benefits , such as food-stamps and housing-subsidies ; and tax-refunds . while in the private sector improper-payments most often-present an internal-problem that threatens profitability , in the public sector they can translate into serving fewer recipients or represent wasteful-spending or a higher relative-tax-burden that prompts questions and criticism from the congress , the media , and the taxpayers . for federal-programs with legislative or regulatory eligibility-criteria , improper-payments indicate that agencies are spending more than necessary to meet program-goals . conversely , for programs with fixed-funds , any waste of federal-funds translates into serving fewer recipients or accomplishing less programmatically than could be expected . despite a climate of increased scrutiny , most improper-payments associated with federal-programs continue to go unidentified as they drain taxpayer-resources away from the missions and goals of our government . they occur for many reasons including insufficient oversight or monitoring , inadequate-eligibility-controls , and automated-system-deficiencies . however , one point is clear based on our study-the basic or root-causes of improper-payments can typically be traced to a lack of or breakdown in internal-control . collectively , internal-controls are an integral-component of an organization 's management that provides reasonable-assurance that the organization achieves its objectives of ( 1 ) effective and efficient-operations , ( 2 ) reliable financial-reporting , and ( 3 ) compliance with laws and regulations . internal-controls are not one event , but a series of actions and activities that occur throughout an entity 's operations and on an ongoing-basis . people make internal-controls-work , and responsibility for good internal-controls rests with all managers . the risk of improper-payments-increases in programs with ( 1 ) complex-criteria for computing-payments , ( 2 ) a significant-volume of transactions , or ( 3 ) emphasis on expediting-payments . since these factors apply to a number of government-programs that collectively disburse-billions of dollars , there is clearly a need for federal-agencies to be ever more vigilant in the design , implementation , and maintenance of proper-controls for safeguarding-assets and preventing and detecting-fraud and errors . the risk of improper-payments and the government 's ability to prevent them will continue to be of concern in the future . under current federal-budget-policies , as the baby-boom-generation leaves the workforce , spending-pressures will grow rapidly-due to increased costs of programs such as medicare , medicaid , and social-security . other federal-expenditures are also likely to increase . the increased size of federal-programs , spending-pressures , implementation of new programs , and changes in existing-programs all but guarantee that , absent-improvements in internal-controls and other proactive-actions , the potential for additional or larger volumes of improper-payments will be present . figure 1 illustrates the reported and projected-trends in certain federal-expenditures , excluding-interest on the public-debt , for fiscal-years 1980 through 2006 . figure 1 : trends in certain actual and projected federal-expenditures : fiscal-years 1980 through

united states government , fiscal year 2002 , historical-tables . the president 's management-agenda , fiscal year 2002 , includes a governmentwide-initiative for improved financial performance . under this initiative , the administration will establish a baseline of the extent of erroneous-payments and require agencies to include , in their fiscal year 2003-budget-submissions , information on erroneous-payment-rates , including actual and target-rates , where available , for benefit and assistance-programs over $ 2 billion . using this information , the office of management and budget will work with agencies to establish goals to reduce erroneous-payments for each program . few would argue that the goal of reducing improper-payments is not a worthy one . but attacking the problem requires a strategy appropriate to the organization involved and its particular-risks , including a consideration of the legal-requirements surrounding security and privacy-issues . the organizations that participated in our study have taken actions that they consider to be effective in reducing-potential as well as actual improper-payments . all of these actions shared a common-focus of improving the internal-control-systems over the problem-area . this focus on internal-controls does not necessarily mean that the programs lacked-controls but that the existing-controls needed to be updated or policies and procedures added to strengthen the overall-control system . in this executive-guide , we highlight many of the strategic actions taken by the study-participants 4to reduce improper-payments . we categorize these actions into the five components of internal-control-control environment , risk-assessment , control-activities , information and communications , and monitoring-outlined in the comptroller general 's standards for internal-control in the federal government ( gao-aimd-00-21.3.1 , november 1999 ) . 5for purposes of this study , we define these components as follows . ● control environment-creating a culture of accountability by establishing a positive and supportive-attitude toward improvement and the achievement of established-program-outcomes . ● risk assessment-performing comprehensive-reviews and analyses of program-operations to determine if risks exist and the nature and extent of the risks identified . ● control activities-taking-actions to address identified risk-areas and help ensure that management 's decisions and plans are carried out and program-objectives are met . ● information and communications-using and sharing relevant , reliable , and timely financial and nonfinancial-information in managing improper-payment related-activities . 4 the examples we have included from these organizations are meant only to illustrate the range and variety of internal-controls that may be useful to federal-agency-managers . they are not all-inclusive and may not include the specific-controls that a particular-agency may need . 5 the federal-managers ' financial-integrity act of 1982 required that we issue standards for internal-control in the federal government . ● monitoring-tracking-improvement-initiatives , over time , and identifying additional-actions needed to further improve program-efficiency and effectiveness . although these internal-control-components are applicable to the entirety of an organization 's operations , 6this-executive-guide focuses on internal-controls as they relate to reducing improper-payments . the following graphic represents the interrelationship between the components and efforts to manage improper-payments . figure 2 : managing-improper-payments through internal-controls while this guide discusses each of these control-areas separately , actions to manage improper-payments would typically require a continual-interaction between these areas . as depicted in the figure , the control-environment-surrounds and reinforces the other components , but all components work in concert toward a central-objective , which , in this case , is managing-improper-payments . we conclude our discussion of the actions taken to address improper-payments with observations about key-factors necessary for success . we have included descriptions of the entities we visited in appendix ii . also , appendix iii identifies other sources of information that may be useful to federal-agencies in their efforts to address improper-payments in their programs . 6see also internal-control management and evaluation tool ( gao-01-1008g , august 2001 ) . the purpose of this tool is to assist-agencies in maintaining or implementing effective internal-control and , as needed , to help determine what , where , and how improvements can be implemented . control-environment : instilling a culture of accountability -changes madein texas might not have happened if the legislature had n't become involved . regulations should not be seen as roadblocks , but as support-orbacking to achieve the agencies' mission . '' ken holcomb , director of systems resources , office of investigations and enforcement , texas health and human-services commission of the elements that are critical to the identification , development , and implementation of activities to reduce improper-payments , perhaps the most significant is the control-environment . by focusing their attention on and communicating their intent to reduce improper-payments throughout an organization and to all affected organizational-units and individuals , top-level officials-whether in the government or within private sector companies-and legislative-bodies set the stage for change . they instill a culture of accountability by adopting a positive and supportive-attitude toward improvement and the achievement of established-program-outcomes . they also establish a transparent environment in which their expectations for program-improvement are clearly defined and accountability for achieving these improvements is set . the actions of the entities in our study in areas including passing-legislation , setting and maintaining the ethical-tone , delegating-roles and responsibilities , and implementing human-capital-initiatives clearly communicated the need for change . we were told by many of the officials we met in the course of our work that , without the clearly established expectations and demands for improvement by top-management and legislative officials , little would have happened to effectively reduce fraud and errors in their programs . however , it is important to note that , while top-management sets the tone for cultural-change , everyone from program-managers to staff performing-day-to-day operational-activities must buy into this change and work to achieve its overall-goals . the cultural-change fostered by an effective-control-environment stresses the importance of improvement and efficient and effective-program-operations , while maintaining a balance with concerns raised regarding-privacy and information-security in a world where computers and electronic-data are indispensable for making-payments . in the legislative-arena , it involved passing-laws requiring certain-actions by agency or program-management , the use of various-prevention and/or detection methodologies , and periodic-agency reporting on the status of improvement-efforts . at the agency or program-level , it included management 's public-commitment to reduce fraud and errors , as -there are two ways to stop fraud-one is to lock up everythingaround you , andthe other is to surround yourself with ethical-people . '' chris linton , certified fraud examiner , national advisor , fraud-prevention and investigation , new zealand 's inland revenue department well as annual-performance-reporting and follow-up-actions based on performance-results . top-level-interest in the amount of improper-payments at the organizations that participated in our study often resulted from program , audit , and/or media reports of misspent-funds or fraudulent-activities . as the magnitude of these improper-payments became known , pressures increased on government officials and legislative-bodies to reduce them . in texas , the legislature was instrumental in effecting-changes to the state 's benefit-programs through provisions in several pieces of legislation . the legislature 's involvement was precipitated in 1996 by the reported amounts of improper-payments in texas ' medicaid program ( estimated to range from $ 365 million to $ 730 million , or 4 to 8 percent of total-expenditures ) and temporary-assistance for needy-families ( tanf ) and food-stamp programs ( estimated at a total of $ 222.4 million , or about 8 percent of total-expenditures for the two programs ) . texas lawmakers sought to reduce improper-payments by mandating specific-actions by responsible-agencies , including the use of computer technology to identify and deter fraud and abuse in the texas medicaid program . in addition , the lawmakers called for publicizing successful-fraud-prosecutions and fraud-prevention-programs to deter benefit-fraud . australia and new zealand prepared and adopted a joint-standard 7on `` risk management , '' to provide a cultural-framework for managing-risk . risk management is the term applied to a logical and systematic-method of managing-risks associated with any activity , function , or process in a way that will enable organizations to minimize losses and maximize opportunities . the philosophy makes risk management a part of its organizational-culture and integrates risk management into its day-to-day practices and business-activities . when this is achieved , risk management becomes the business of everyone in the organization . people are what make internal-controls-work , and the integrity and ethical-values maintained and demonstrated by management play a key role in the entire-organization 's ethical-tone . after the identification of significant internal-fraud , new zealand 's inland revenue department ( ird ) created the position of national advisor , fraud-prevention and investigation , and adopted a fraud-control strategy . the primary-aim of the strategy is to enable responsible conduct , where the need to obey the law and to behave ethically is part of the organization 's ethos . accordingly , ird has adopted a code of conduct applicable to all employees that explains the standards of integrity and behavior expected . in the experience of ird 's national advisor , fraud-prevention and investigation , employees are often provided a copy of the code of conduct 7 joint australian/new zealand standard 4360:1999 was prepared by the joint technical committee ob/7-risk management . it was approved on behalf of the council of standards australia on april 2 , 1999 , and on behalf of the council of standards new zealand on march 22 , 1999 . it was published on april 12 , 1999 . referenced-material is from pages iii and 1 of the standard . -good customer service is accurate-customer-service . while timeliness is important , quality and accuracy aremore-important and will ultimately improve timeliness anyway . '' sue vardon , chief-executive-officer , centrelink on their first day of work , along with a large-volume of other paperwork , and never actually read the code unless the code is breached . to heighten employee-awareness , ird holds roundtable discussions with new and seasoned-employees , which bring the code to life in terms of everyday-business-activity . while many organizations have programs to deter and detect fraudulent-payments , improper-payments resulting from miscalculation and other errors often receive inadequate-attention . centrelink , a `` one-stop-shop '' that pays a variety of australian-government-benefits , has recently made it its business to improve payment-accuracy . centrelink was established in 1997 with a strong focus on customer service and the goal of paying-beneficiaries promptly . however , in recent years , internal and external-audit reports showed that centrelink had , to some extent , traded-quality for timeliness . centrelink 's own internal-review showed that up to 30 percent of all work was rework because it was not done correctly the first time . the organization 's management responded by implementing a `` getting it right '' strategy in 2000 , which established a tone for change by setting out ● the roles and responsibilities of managers and team leaders , including setting clear and measurable-goals in line with centrelink 's strategic-framework and meeting-performance-measures , and ● minimum-standards to be applied by all staff in establishing-proof of identity of customers , managing-records , keeping technical-knowledge and skills current , recording-reasons for payment-decisions , and checking-work comprehensively . centrelink has distributed posters and mouse-pads to reinforce the `` getting it right '' message and has provided resources to staff on how to reach minimum-standards . through implementation of the '' getting it right '' strategy , the centrelink chief-executive-officer has stated that she expects a reduction in improper-payments as well as continued-timeliness in payments to beneficiaries . activities that must be undertaken for each program , to ensure the quality of assessment and services provided , are being developed . a number have already been released for implementation in centrelink 's customer service centre network . 8 in june 2001 the department of social-security was renamed the department for work and pensions ( dwp ) . 9 amounts included in this report have been converted to u.s. dollars using the following-exchange-rates , effective april 16 , 2001 , for one u.s. dollar : 0.697064 british-pounds , 1.95665 australian-dollars , and 2.43533 new zealand dollars . ● putting it right-detecting when payments go wrong and taking prompt-action to correct them with appropriate-penalties to prevent recurrence , and ● making sure our strategy works-monitoring-progress , evaluating the strength of controls , and making-adjustments where needed . dwp 's strategy also established-performance-measures for the reduction of the amount of losses from fraud and error in the income-support and jobseeker 's allowance-benefit-programs . to kick off its new program , dwp launched a publicity-campaign against `` benefit-cheats '' to shift public-attitude and promote intolerance toward those who defraud the benefit-system . additionally , television-commercials , billboards , newspaper-articles , and an antifraud web site ( www.targetingfraud.gov.uk ) communicated the government 's message to the public that fraud and abuse of the benefits-system would not be tolerated . parliament has also stayed actively involved in benefit-payment reform and improper-payment-reductions . for example , it enacted-legislation authorizing-data sharing-activities within and between government agencies and departments . also the treasury requires departments to disclose instances of irregular-expenditures arising from erroneous-benefit-awards and fraud by claimants . further , the comptroller and auditor-general has qualified his opinion on dwp's fiscal year 1995 through fiscal year 2000 financial statements because of the level of fraud and error identified in the benefit-programs . this served to reinforce the message that high levels of improper-payments are unacceptable in the united kingdom . among the organizations we studied , the pressures applied by oversight-entities and top-management were instrumental as change-agents . they not only defined and communicated a need for improved program-operations but , most important , they redefined the organizational-culture . further , by being transparent in redefining the culture , oversight-entities and top-management set-expectations and obtained-buy-in on the need for and importance of change from individuals throughout the organizations . this was critical for success since these individuals managed the day-to-day-program activities . further , a culture of accountability was essential to begin the critical next-step in managing-improper-payments , the risk-assessment-process . strategies to consider-control environment to create a control-environment that instills a culture of accountability over improper-payments , the following-strategies should be considered : ● provide leadership in setting and maintaining the agency 's ethical-code of conduct and in ensuring proper-behavior under the code ; ● provide a cultural-framework for managing-risk by engaging-everyone in the organization in the risk management process ; ● increase-accountability by establishing-goals for reducing improper-payments for major-programs ; and ● foster an atmosphere that regards improper-payments as unacceptable . risk-assessment : determining the nature and extent of the problem -one of the worst problems an organization confronts is the problem of institutional-denial . an organization should not simply say , `` we know we have a problem , but we do n't want to know how big it is . ' '' aurora lebrun , associate commissioner , office of investigations and enforcement , texas health and human-services commission strong-systems of internal-control provide reasonable-assurance that programs are operating as intended and are achieving expected outcomes . a key-step in the process of gaining this assurance is conducting a risk-assessment , an activity that entails a comprehensive-review and analysis of program-operations to determine where risks exist and what those risks are , and then measuring the potential or actual-impact of those risks on program-operations . in performing a risk-assessment , management should consider all significant-interactions between the entity and other parties , as well as all internal-factors at both the organizationwide and program-levels . once risk-areas are identified , their potential-impact on programs and activities should be measured and additional-controls should be considered . as risks are addressed and controls are changed , they should occasionally be revisited to determine where the risks have decreased and where new areas of risk may exist . as such , the risk-assessment-process should be iterative . the information developed during a risk-assessment forms the foundation or basis upon which management can determine the nature and type of corrective-actions needed , and it gives management baseline-information for measuring-progress in reducing improper-payments . the specific risk-analysis methodology used can vary by organization because of differences in missions and the difficulty in qualitatively and quantitatively assigning-risk-levels . in addition , because governmental , economic , industry , regulatory , and operating-conditions continually change , risk-assessments should be periodically updated to identify and deal with any special-risks prompted by such changes . the organizations that participated in our study found that conducting-risk-assessments , to determine the nature and extent of their improper-payments , was an essential-step in helping them focus on the most significant-problem-areas and determine what needed to be done to address the identified risks in those areas . many federal-agencies , even those with recognized weaknesses that result in improper-payments , do not perform risk-assessments to identify and estimate the magnitude of improper-payments within their programs . however , some agencies do perform risk-assessments . for example , the department of health and human-services ( hhs ) began reporting an annual-estimate of improper-payments in the medicare fee-for-service-program in 1996 . in fiscal year 2000 , it reported estimated improper medicare fee-for-service-payments of $ 11.9 billion , or about 7 percent of such benefits . hhs ' reporting and analysis of improper medicare payments has helped lead to the implementation of several-initiatives to identify and reduce such payments . these initiatives include working with providers to ensure that medical-records support billed services . a thorough-risk-assessment also allows entities to target high-risk-areas and , therefore , to focus often limited-resources where the greatest exposure exists . for example , the illinois department of public aid ( idpa ) conducted a 1998 comparison of medicaid payments made with information and documentation associated with the claims to determine if the payments were accurate . from this information , the idpa calculated that the state 's payment-accuracy-rate was about 95 percent . the review identified errors and their causes and provided idpa with information that allowed it to focus attention on the 5 percent of inaccurate-payments and target-strategies to improve the accuracy of these payments . for example , of the $ 37.2 million spent for nonemergency-transportation-services included in the study , $ 11.55 million ( 31 percent ) were estimated to be in error . the payment-accuracy-review and three other studies led to a series of actions that included assuring that transportation-providers actually existed and were providing-services , assuring that providers billed medicaid correctly , and sending-notices to let providers know what is expected of them . texas has performed two reviews of the accuracy of its health care-payments-one in december 1998 and a second in january 2001 . both reviews of the medicaid program were designed to measure the incidence of potential-overpayments that could be due to fraud and abuse . the 2001 study used three different types of analyses-client telephone-interviews , data-analysis ( identifying-billing-trends that are known to result in overpayments ) , and medical-record review . documentation errors , clerical-errors , and potential-fraud and abuse were identified . texas used the results to improve its fraud and abuse-detection-process by considering certain-high-risk areas in the development of data-analysis-techniques in its medicaid fraud and abuse detection system ( mfads ) . for example , it recommended an increase in analyses targeted at medical-supplies and durable medical-equipment and at providers who bill higher cost procedure-codes to maximize their reimbursement . both texas and illinois found the first-time-payment-accuracy review to be expensive- $ 250,000 and $ 400,000 in direct-costs , respectively . however , both states recognized that the cost of risk-assessments would decrease after the baseline-measurement had been determined , and found them to be cost-beneficial in light of the ability to focus on high-risk-areas . resources are maximized when strategically aimed at the areas that need the most improvement . thus , they regarded the payment-accuracy-review as an effective and cost-beneficial way to combat improper-payments . government agencies in other countries also use payment-accuracy reviews to identify risk-areas . for example , the department of social-security in the united kingdom uses the results of a rolling program of reviews to determine the levels of fraud and error in its income-support and jobseeker 's allowance-benefit-programs . specifically , these reviews quantify the amount of fraud , customer error , and official-error ( error by government-employees ) affecting benefit-claims . the government uses the october 1997 through september 1998-review-results as a baseline against which the results of subsequent-reviews are measured . further , dwp in the united kingdom plans to use this information to target areas for prevention and detection in the benefit-programs , to identify customers who are at risk for higher levels of error in their claims , and to facilitate case-interventions . `` control-activities will not be fully-effective until everyone , from the person on the counter through to the head of the agency , takes responsibility for managing-risk from the perspective of their respective-positions . '' ralph watzlaff , general manager , professional review division , australian health insurance commission in our study of activities to reduce improper-payments , risk-assessments identified-problem-areas and resulted in estimates of monetary-values associated with the problems . thus , the process of doing risk-assessments was essential for evaluating the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the various corrective-actions considered . the organizations viewed-risk-assessments as opportunity , and identified risk-areas were communicated throughout the organization . assessing its risks allows an organization to set-goals and target its efforts to reduce improper-payments . having developed such a framework , an organization is well positioned to determine which control-activities to implement to reduce risks and ultimately reduce fraud and errors . strategies to consider-risk assessment to assess risk by determining the nature and extent of improper-payments , the following-strategies should be considered : ● institute a systematic-process to estimate the level of improper-payments being made by the organization ; ● based on this process , determine where risks exist , what those risks are , and the potential or actual-impact of those risks on program-operations ; ● use risk-assessment results to target high-risk-areas and focus-resources where the greatest exposure exists ; and ● reassess-risks on a recurring-basis to evaluate the impact of changing-conditions , both external and internal , on program-operations . control-activities : taking-action to address identified risk-areas -there are no brownie-points for just talking about the problem . '' joan mcquay , national benefit control and debt manager , work and income new zealand once an organization has identified-areas of its operations that are at risk and quantified the possible-extent of the risk , and its management and other key-officials are committed to and have set a goal for reducing the risk , the organization must take action to achieve that goal . control-activities are the policies , procedures , techniques , and mechanisms that are designed to help ensure that management 's decisions and plans are carried out . they include activities designed to address risks that lead to fraud and error . they are an integral part of an organization 's actions in planning , implementing , reviewing , and achieving effective-results . the control-activities used by an organization to address improper-payments vary according to the specific-threats faced and risks incurred ; differences in objectives ; managerial-judgment ; size and complexity of the organization ; operational-environment ; sensitivity and value of data ; and requirements for system-reliability , availability , and performance . additionally , they must comply with all relevant-laws and help strike a balance between the sometimes competing-goals of privacy and program-integrity . control-activities can include both prepayment and postpayment-mechanisms to manage improper-payments . given the large-volume and complexity of federal-payments and historically low-recovery-rates for certain programs , it is generally most efficient to pay bills and provide benefits properly in the first place . aside from minimizing overpayments , proactively preventing improper-payments-increases public-confidence in the administration of benefit-programs and avoids the difficulties associated with the `` pay and chase '' 10aspects of recovering improper-payments . however , recognizing that some overpayments are inevitable , agencies also need to adopt effective-detection-techniques to quickly identify and recover them . detection-activities play a significant-role not only in identifying improper-payments , but also in providing-data 10 '' pay and chase '' refers to the labor-intensive and time-consuming-practice of trying to recover overpayments once they have already been made rather than preventing improper-payments in the first place . on why these payments were made and , in turn , highlighting-areas that need strengthened-prevention-controls . the organizations in our study used many different-prevention and detection-control-activities to manage improper-payments . the nature of these activities ranged from sophisticated-computer analyses of beneficiary and program-participant-data to postaward contract-audits . the kinds of activities pursued were dictated by the types of payment-activities each entity had identified as presenting the most significant-risk of improper-payments as well as the kind of data and other resources that were available to the entity in this effort . this guide discusses the following six kinds of control-activities : ● data-sharing , ● data-mining , ● neural-networking , ● recovery-auditing , ● contract-audits , and ● prepayment-investigations . the data-sharing , data-mining , and neural-networking-techniques discussed in this guide are powerful internal-control-tools that provide more useful and timely-access to information . the use of these techniques can achieve potentially-significant savings by identifying client-related-reporting-errors and misinformation during the eligibility determination process-before payments are made-or by detecting improper-payments that have been made . however , the more extensive-use of personal information in an evolving technological-environment raises new questions about privacy and how it should be protected . in the federal-arena , such activities must be implemented consistent with all protections of the privacy act of 1974 , as amended by the computer-matching and privacy protection act of 1988 , and other privacy-statutes . data-sharing allows entities that make payments-to contractors , vendors , or participants in benefit-programs-to compare information from different-sources to help ensure that payments are appropriate . for government agencies , data-sharing can be particularly-useful in confirming initial or continuing eligibility of participants in benefit-programs and in identifying improper-payments that have already been made . 11 a form of data-sharing that texas has found to be effective for determining the initial-eligibility of individuals for food-stamp-benefits puts information from several-state and local-agencies in 11see also benefit and loan-programs : improved-data sharing could enhance program-integrity ( gao/hehs-00-119 , september 13 , 2000 ) . the hands of state-caseworkers by means of a vendor-provided software-program . the vendor maintains public-information , such as that recorded by local-department of motor-vehicles or municipal courts , where it can be easily searched by caseworkers to evaluate information provided by individuals applying for benefits . using the software , caseworkers can target questions to applicants when there are discrepancies between information provided by the clients and that recorded elsewhere . caseworkers can search the database for data such as driver 's license-information , records showing the number of individuals or vehicles at the clients ' reported addresses , telephone-numbers , vehicle-values , boat and motor-files , criminal-convictions , marriage/divorce records , and consumer-credit reports . then , for example , if the data-search shows two cars at an applicant 's address when the benefit-applicant has reported only one , the caseworker can , at the time of the benefit-application , question the applicant concerning this discrepancy . generally , this query-information is treated only as a `` case-clue '' and must be verified . the database contains reporting-options that allow supervisors to monitor employees ' use of the system to ensure that all queries are appropriate-in-addition , the state 's internal auditor monitors the staff 's use of the database . beyond determining initial-eligibility of participants in benefit-programs , data-sharing can also be used to identify improper-payments that have already been made . data-sharing allows a flow of information in two directions , which is particularly-helpful to some organizations in managing-improper-payments . for example , the social-security administration ( ssa ) obtains death records from states to determine if deceased-individuals are receiving-benefit-checks . at the same time , ssa provides data to states and other agencies . among the data it shares is notification of whether there is a valid social-security-number to confirm the eligibility of an applicant for various-state or federal-benefit programs . the exchange of information allows data matches to take place , a process in which information from one source is compared with information from another to identify any inconsistencies . data matches of social-security-numbers and other data can help determine whether beneficiaries are receiving-payments inappropriately or under more than one name or address . ssa performs over 20 data matches with over 10 federal-agencies and more than 3,500 state and local-entities using-incoming information . additionally , ssa shares outgoing-information with federal-agencies through more than 15 matches . for example , ssa shares-data with the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) so it can perform a match to verify the identity of recipients of housing-benefits and identify potentially-fraudulent claims . ssa uses data matches to prevent and detect improper-payments in its programs . it estimates that it saves $ 350 million annually for old age and survivors-insurance and disability insurance , and $ 325 million annually for supplemental-security-income through the use of data-matching . further , the savings are not limited to ssa data matches save $ 1.5 billion for other governmentagencies each year . those realized by ssa . according to ssa , its matches save approximately $ 1.5 billion each year for other agencies . 12 data matches to identify improper-payments can be performed periodically ( i.e. , daily , monthly , or yearly ) or on an ad hoc basis , using various-sources of data to reconfirm-eligibility of beneficiaries and accuracy of payments . texas conducts both periodic and ad hoc matches using-data including ● prisoner-information obtained from the texas department of criminal-justice and ssa 's prisoner verification-system ( to determine whether prisoners are receiving-benefits to which they are not entitled ) , ● deceased-individuals-lists obtained from the texas department of health bureau of vital-statistics ( to determine whether benefits are being paid to such individuals ) , and ● income-information obtained from the texas employees retirement system ( to check retiree-income for amounts that affect the level of benefit-eligibility ) . texas also shares-data with three of its bordering-states to determine duplicity of benefits , which , for the four states , has resulted in an average of 337-potential-duplicates per state per quarter . in fiscal year 2000 , after researching potential-duplicate payments , texas denied or decreased-benefits in 656 cases , resulting in approximately $ 578,000 in benefits saved . kentucky performs data matches to determine eligibility for food-stamps , tanf , and medicaid benefits using an integrated automated-system that lets caseworkers determine eligibility for the three programs simultaneously . at the time the application is entered into the system , the system performs several matches to obtain additional information on the applicant and prevent duplicate participation . these matches are made through its income eligibility and verification-system using the applicant 's social-security-number , name , date of birth , any previous-disqualification record from assistance-programs , and income . in addition , on a monthly-basis , other matches are conducted . the state matches data with the national crime information-center to check for fleeing felons , with ssa to determine if any clients are in prison or have died , and with assistance-programs in other states to check for client-disqualification . in addition , matches with unemployment and state-wages-records are done monthly . when these matches result in information that could require changes in benefits , the matches appear on the daily case status-reports , alerting-caseworkers to potential-changes in benefits . the united kingdom formalized-data matching between government-organizations in 1995 , and it reported that , through march 2000 , it had realized benefit-savings of about $ 450 million . from april 1999 through 12 ssa calculates the annual-savings based on a compilation of cost-benefit-analyses performed by the matching-agencies under the terms of their matching-agreements with ssa . march 2000 , matches identified about 217,000 inconsistencies for further investigation , and resulted in an overall-benefit saving of about $ 53 million . additionally , legislation has now been passed to enable the government to obtain financial information from the private sector in certain-circumstances . the prevalence of data-sharing is evidence of the value provided to agencies when they can obtain and use data from sources external to an individual-program 's systems . having the two streams of data allows for matches to occur and inconsistencies or anomalies to be flagged for further research . federal-entities contemplating-data matching must do so in accordance with the provisions of the computer-matching and privacy protection act , which requires that ( 1 ) the privacy of data used in computer matches be protected , ( 2 ) agencies complete-cost-benefit-analyses on all computer matches and report annually on their findings , unless the matches are exempted by law , and ( 3 ) data-integrity-boards be established to approve and review the data matches . while data-sharing gives an organization the means to compare data from different-sources , data-mining offers a tool to review and analyze diverse-data . data-mining analyzes data for relationships that have not previously been discovered . for example , the incidence of improper-payments among medicaid claims might , if sufficiently analyzed and related to other medicaid data , reveal a correlation with a certain health-care-provider or providers . the central-repository of data commonly used to perform data-mining is called a data-warehouse . data warehouses store historical and current-data and consist of tables of information that are logically grouped together . the warehouse allows program and financial-data from different nonintegrated-systems throughout an organization to be captured and placed in a single-database where users can query the system for information . the information can then be `` mined '' or searched according to specific-criteria to identify associations , sequences , patterns , and clusters between different-pieces of information-relationships that are often hidden in separated-databases . as a tool in managing-improper-payments , applying-data-mining to a data-warehouse allows an organization to efficiently query the system to identify questionable-activities , such as multiple payments for an individual-invoice or to an individual-recipient on a certain-date . this technique allows personnel who are not computer-specialists , but who may have useful-program or financial expertise , to directly-access-data , target-queries , and analyze results . queries can also be made through data-mining-software , which includes prepared-queries that can be used in the system on a regular basis . idpa began-data-mining in an effort to improve a system that was too slow to provide the timely-information needed for a wide-range of agency-functions , including the prevention and detection of overpayments . as of december 2000 , the state had spent $ 29 million to create a data-warehouse to supplement the medicaid management-information-system ( mmis ) , which maintains data on medicaid providers and beneficiaries as well as claims and payments . the data-warehouse includes over 2,000 different fields/elements . the results of data-queries are particularly-useful because the data-warehouse is able to store more current-data than mmis . at present , there is a 1-month lag in current-information , compared to the 3- to 6-month lag that existed before idpa began using-data-mining . in addition , the data-warehouse can now store up to 5 years of data , and idpa is currently weighing the costs and benefits of increasing this to 10 years of data . idpa officials noted that using-data-mining allows them to analyze large amounts of data . because the large number of transactions in the system precludes manually examining each transaction for associations and patterns with other transactions , data-mining is an effective and efficient-alternative . the idpa office of inspector-general ( oig ) also uses data-mining to quickly respond to requests for information for ongoing-investigations from the federal bureau of investigation and the illinois state-police . the idpa oig created the fraud science team ( fst ) , an interdisciplinary-team that includes an economist , program and policy-experts , and information-specialists . fst maximizes the value of the data-warehouse by performing data-mining-activities and providing a research-based-approach to fraud-prevention and detection . fst has produced documentation on over 800 fraud schemes , which it has categorized into 19 different types , such as billing for services not rendered and kickback-schemes . the information on these schemes is used in the development and implementation of targeted-analyses that are run against the data-warehouse information to identify data-relationships and anomalies , which are often-signs of fraud . this information can also be used to implement specific-controls in the system intended to prevent the identified types of fraud . during our visit , the idpa oig staff ran several-queries and analyses . for example , one risk-area identified was health-care-providers that were billing for services provided in excess of 24 hours in a single day . with the capabilities of the data-warehouse , oig staff developed an analysis that identified 18 providers that had billed over 24 hours for at least 1 day during the 6 months ended december 31 , 1999 . a number of the identified providers were already under investigation for other program-violations . as a result of this analysis , the oig plans to refer serious-cases to appropriate law-enforcement-agencies and take administrative-action against the less serious-violators . an early-effort at using-data-mining software in illinois has identified $ 1.7 million in potential-overpayments . before the data-warehouse was available , obtaining-responses to queries of this kind would have required obtaining separate-reports from different-systems and could have taken up to 2 months . however , during our visit querying the warehouse took from several seconds to a few minutes per query . new initiatives that illinois expects will further improve data-mining at idpa are the development of a 3-day training course to help users properly structure queries and the use of data-mining-software . in an early-effort using-data-mining software , idpa oig , as part of a partnership-audit with hhs oig , identified 232 hospital-transfers that are believed to have been miscoded as discharges , creating a potential-overpayment of $ 1.7 million . the large number of computerized-claims processed by medicare also lends itself to the application of data-mining-techniques . claims-administration-contractors at hhs ' centers for medicare and medicaid services ( formerly the health care financing administration ) use data-mining and statistical-analysis as part of their postpayment-review-activities . since 1993 , cms also has contracted with a specialized statistical-analysis-contractor to perform large-scale-analysis of durable medical-equipment-claims . data-mining can identify many potentially inappropriate-payments , but determining which ones are actual-overpayments takes additional-investigation . currently , the contractors only have the resources to investigate situations in which the data indicate potential large-scale abusive-practices . neural-networking is a technique for extracting and analyzing-data . in this case , the system analyzes associations and patterns among data-elements , which allows it to find relationships that can result in new queries . a neural-network is intended to simulate the way in which a brain processes information , learns , and remembers . a neural-network is initially `` trained '' or fed large amounts of data and rules about data-relationships ( for example , `` a person's grandfather is older than that person 's father '' ) . neural-networks '' learn '' by comparing new data with historical-data and can be used to detect patterns that are difficult , and sometimes-impossible , to detect without computer-intervention in large-volumes of data . the more data a neural-network processes the better it performs ( i.e. , the better it identifies the characteristics of potentially-fraudulent payments ) . based upon this knowledge , neural-networks automatically alter their analytical-processes to produce more accurate-detection-results . in 1997 , the texas legislature mandated the use of neural-networks in the medicaid program . after examining the results of a pilot-test texas ' medicaid fraud and abuse detection system used neural-networking to recover $ 3.4 million in fiscal year 2000. of neural-networks conducted by the comptroller 's office , texas' health and human-services commission ( hhsc ) responded to the legislation and implemented mfads . the mfads project was operational in january 1998 and combines both data-mining and neural-network-capabilities . in texas , models used with the neural-network-technology identify fraudulent-patterns from large-volumes of medical-claims and patient and provider-history-data . for example , they can help identify perpetrators of both known and unknown-fraud-schemes through the analysis of utilization-trends , patterns , and complex interrelationships in the data . the state currently has models for physician and dental-providers and plans to initiate a model for pharmaceutical-providers . hhsc awarded a contract for the development and operational support of mfads . annual-contract-costs range from $ 2.6 million to $ 3.1 million for contractor-operations that include the development and ongoing-support of the models . the texas models are composed of 500 to 600 variables and generate an annual report that identifies the potential unscrupulous-providers and ranks the providers according to how questionable their billing-patterns appear to be . the models-detail the variances through graphs that compare amounts billed and services rendered ( among others-items ) by the identified provider with the average of the other providers . for example , one dental-provider was ranked third on a dental-model-listing due to unusual-activity in areas such as multisurface-restoration and root canal-activities . an investigator , using mfads , was able to run detailed-reports on the provider 's activity in the identified high-risk-areas and determined that the combination of services provided , volume of services provided , and the recurring-pattern of the services provided were indeed-suspicious . additionally , a dental-consultant reviewed 100 of the provider 's dental-charts and determined that many of the services claimed were unnecessary . as a result , the provider agreed to a settlement and has repaid the identified overpayments of $ 162,000 plus other penalties . additionally , the provider was excluded from the medicaid program for 15 years . the results from both the data-mining-activities and the neural-network reports are reviewed and possibly investigated to determine if the claims are fraudulent or the providers are unscrupulous . according to texas officials , medical-judgment is important when considering the accuracy of claims , and , as such , medical-professionals assist in reviewing medical-claims . texas ' hhsc prepares quarterly-reports for the legislature's review . the second quarter fiscal year 2001 contract-performance report for the medicaid fraud and abuse detection system reported that it had identified 2,567 cases ( representing over $ 6 million ) for investigation in fiscal year 2000 . as a result of investigating these cases , approximately $ 3.4 million has been recovered . these reports also show how hhsc is performing in relation to its performance-measures . in fiscal year 2000 , one of the performance-measures was that total-dollars identified for recoveries equal or exceed 139 percent ( $ 3.7 million ) of the fiscal year contract-cost amount . hhsc exceeded its goal by identifying $ 6.1 million for recovery . recovery-auditing is the practice of identifying and recovering-overpayments that examines payment file information to identify possible-duplicate or erroneous-payments . for instance , vendors make pricing-errors on their invoices , forget to include discounts that have been publicized to the general-public , neglect to offer allowances and rebates , miscalculate-freight-charges , and so forth . in addition , the same invoices , or portions thereof , could be paid more than once . these mistakes , when not caught , result in overpayments . recovery-auditing can incorporate data-mining-techniques . while traditionally used as a technique to identify improper-payments already made , organizations have also experienced success in using-recovery-auditing to analyze records prior to payment . because it helps to prevent improper-payments before they occur , this use of recovery-auditing eliminates the costs associated with obtaining-reimbursements for the erroneous-payments or taking other actions needed to offset future-payments by the amount of the improper-payment . recovery-auditing started about 30 years ago , and it is used in several-industries , including the automobile , retail-store , and food-service-industries , and , to some extent , within the federal government . some entities use their employees to analyze their payment records while others-contract with recovery-audit-firms for the work . contract-firms often perform this work on a contingency-fee-basis , that is , they only receive compensation if they identify and recover amounts determined to be improper-payments . as discussed below , recovery-auditing , which has a long-standing-track record in the private sector , offers an opportunity to identify improper-payments before they occur and to identify and recover overpayments if they do occur . ● one private-sector-company contracted , on a contingency-fee-basis , with a recovery-audit-firm for a review of its accounts-payable files- files in which its systems ' controls had not found errors . the review resulted in the recovery of $ 8 million in improper-payments . the company recently began using-recovery-auditing techniques on accounts-payable information to prevent improper-payments before they occurred . it expected that this activity would identify possible-duplicate-payments , and the test verified the company 's expectations . for example , during our visit , it identified and avoided a duplicate-payment of $ 136,000 from the reports generated by the recovery-audit a private sector companyrecovered $ 8 million in improper-payments as a result of a recovery-audit . software . in addition , as a result of using-recovery-auditing before payments are made , the company identified and stopped the processing of $ 41 million in wire-payments that had already been processed . another advantage of the recovery-audit-services used by the company is that the software identifies the employees who are making-processing-errors so that the company can take appropriate counseling and training-action . ● another private-sector-company contracted with a recovery-audit-firm , on a contingency-fee-basis , to perform two separate reviews of its disbursements-the first review was for disbursements made from 1992 through 1995 , and the second for disbursements made from 1996 through 1998 . both reviews identified duplicate-payments and resulted in recovery-actions and in changes to the payment-system to help reduce future-overpayments . for example , from 1996 through 1998 , the company processed about 9 million invoices . the recovery-audit-review of these invoices identified about $ 5 million in potential-overpayments and resulted in actions to recover these funds , where appropriate . further , based on an analysis of the overpayments identified , the company has implemented procedures that have reduced its dollar-error-rate per one million dollars of transactions from a reported $ 65 in 1992 through 1995 to a reported $ 34 dollars in 1996 through 1998 . in addition , the company is now preparing to enter an agreement with the recovery-audit-contractor under which the recovery-auditing-software will be installed in the company 's system , allowing its staff to perform the recovery-audit function-even as part of the prepayment-process . recovery-auditing is also being used to some extent in the federal government . for example , the department of veterans affairs ' ( va ) financial services center ( fsc ) in austin , texas , had contracted with recovery-audit-firms in the past , but now performs recovery-auditing-in-house using about three full-time-employees to administer the program and one employee for software-development . if a duplicate-payment is identified , va takes one of several actions , including canceling the transaction prior to payment , notifying treasury to stop issuance of a check , or issuing a bill of collection . for example , fsc has identified over $ 2 million in overpayments and has collected , by either offsetting-future payments or cash-collection , nearly $ 300,000 for the first 6 months of fiscal year 2001 . a fsc official noted that recovery-auditing could be beneficial to almost any organization that makes payments . postaward-audits of contracts are another technique that can help to combat improper-payments and are used , to some degree , within the federal government . these audits verify that va reported-recoveries of $ 119 million from contract-audits . payments are being made in accordance with contract-terms and applicable-regulations . they can detect improper-payments that have been made , help avoid future-payments of the same kind , and provide oversight of companies conducting-business with the government . for example , in fiscal year 1993 , the va office of acquisition and materiel-management partnered with the va oig and the va office of general counsel to establish the va procurement working-group ( pwg ) . as a result , a contract review and evaluation division was established to provide audit and advisory-services related to contracts awarded by contracting-officers in va 's office of acquisition and materiel-management . from 1993 through september 2000 , pwg reported-recoveries resulting from postaward-audits of contracts totaling about $ 119 million . this represents a reported return of $ 18 for every dollar spent in support of these audits . pwg attributes its success to the establishment of a knowledgeable and professional-group of contract-auditors in the pharmaceutical and medical/surgical supply industries . as a result of the audits and pwg 's efforts , many contractors have voluntarily elected to perform internal-reviews and have submitted 65 voluntary-disclosures and refund offers to va . prior to 1993 , va received almost no voluntary-disclosures . some contractors have also developed and implemented corporate-responsibility plans to ensure compliance with acquisition-regulations and statutes . illinois reports saving $ 12 for every dollar spent on fraud-prevention investigations . in 1996 , idpa established a fraud-prevention investigations program ( fpi ) to prevent ineligible-persons from receiving food-stamps , tanf , and medicaid . under this program , case-managers in the illinois department of human-services ( idhs ) refer applications that contain suspicious or conflicting-information to idpa 's bureau of investigations ( boi ) for action before benefit-payments begin . case-managers use certain referral-criteria , such as applications that contain contradictory-information about household-composition or employment , to identify these applications . boi submits referred cases to a private-investigation-firm , under contract with the idpa oig , which investigates the information on the application . this investigation may consist of interviews ; contacts with employers , landlords , or neighbors ; or a visit to the applicant 's home . the results are reported to boi within 8-business-days ( 5-business-days for food-stamps ) and then to the local idhs office for appropriate action- approval , denial , or reduction of benefits . the program was piloted in 1995 and was implemented in 1996 , with five cook county ( chicago ) idhs offices participating . currently , all 23 idhs local-offices in cook county participate in the program . fpi reports total-savings , since program-inception , of about $ 12 for every dollar spent . specifically , in fiscal year 2000 , fpi prevented $ 9.5 million in improper-payments from being issued at a cost of $ 823,000 . savings are calculated based on the administrative and contract-costs of the program as a percentage of gross-savings and cost-avoidance for cases that resulted in denied or reduced benefits . the preceding-examples of control-activities are meant to illustrate a sample of the type of activities that may be useful to agency-managers . an agency 's internal-control-activities should be flexible , weighing-costs and benefits , to allow agencies to tailor control-activities to fit their special-needs . once control-activities are in place , the internal-control-cycle continues with the prompt-communication of information that managers need to help them carry out these activities and run their operations efficiently and effectively . strategies to consider-control activities in taking-action to address identified risks , the following-strategies should be considered : ● based on an analysis of the specific-risks facing the organization , and taking into consideration the nature of the organization and the environment in which it operates , determine which types of control-activities would be most effective in addressing the identified risks ; ● where in-house-expertise is not available , investigate the possibility of contracting-activities out to firms that specialize in specific-areas , such as recovery-auditing and neural-networking ; ● perform cost-benefit-analyses of potential-control activities before implementation to help ensure that the cost of those activities to the organization is not greater than the potential-benefit-control ; ● ensure that personnel involved in developing , maintaining , and implementing-control-activities have the requisite skills and knowledge , recognizing that staff-expertise needs to be frequently updated in evolving-areas such as information technology and fraud-investigation ; and ● recognize and consider the importance of privacy and information-security-issues when developing and implementing-control-activities . information and communications : using and sharing-knowledge to manage improper-payments top-level-agency-officials , program-managers , and others responsible for managing and controlling-program-operations need relevant , reliable , and timely financial and nonfinancial-information to make operating-decisions , monitor performance , and allocate resources . this information can be obtained from a variety of sources using a wide-range of data-collection-methodologies . the organizations that participated in our study used internal and external-sources to obtain needed-information . further , these sources varied widely , from information contained in multiple computer-databases to periodic-meetings of individuals to share information on emerging-issues and other areas relevant to effective-program-operations . the need for information and communication extends beyond organizational-boundaries . many of the governmental-programs with improper-payments are benefit-programs that involve recipients and providers of services . organizations in our study developed educational-programs to assist these participants in understanding eligibility and other requirements and , for service providers , information on issues including common-claim filing errors . having information available to provide feedback to management on initiatives is necessary to adequately evaluate performance . at centrelink in australia , information showing-achievement against key-performance-indicators ( kpi ) for compliance-activity is provided to managers monthly , within 9 days of the end of the month . information is provided about the number of compliance reviews ( cases identified as high risk for incorrect-payment ) completed , savings , incorrect-payments identified for recovery , and the level of incorrect-payment . information is also provided on prosecution-activity . in addition , comparative-information is made available so that the managers see how they are doing compared to other managers . while these reports are available within 9 days of the end of the reporting-period , a database containing-review information can be accessed within 48 hours . this enables managers to produce detailed , flexible , reports on-line . as a result '' we are always working to achieve balance between program-integrity and access to health care for recipients . '' robb miller , inspector-general , illinois department of public aid of having this timely-information , managers can more effectively manage the resources available to them . minimizing improper-payments often requires the exchange of relevant , reliable , and timely-information between individuals and units within an organization and with external-entities with oversight and monitoring-responsibilities . this can be achieved by establishing working-groups . for example , in 1997 illinois established its medicaid fraud-prevention executive workgroup . the purpose of the workgroup is to develop reasonable and prudent measures consistent with the provision of quality-health-care to combat-fraud and abuse in the medical-assistance program . the workgroup has approximately 15 members from both the program and integrity-sides of idpa , including-members from claims-processing , technical-support , budget and analysis , fraud-research , investigations , information technology , and information-systems . the cooperation between the program and the integrity-divisions is the vehicle by which emerging-issues are addressed . the group meets monthly to discuss the status of previously discussed and/or implemented initiatives and to propose and discuss current-problems and potential-initiatives . topics discussed have resulted in ongoing-changes to computer-edits and policies , reflecting the dynamic-nature of fraud . while timely , accurate , and reliable-information is necessary for internal-use , the organizations we visited stressed that communication with the public , benefit-providers , and beneficiaries was also necessary . educating the parties involved in the transaction reduces the risk of potential-errors and strengthens joint-responsibility and accountability of those involved . texas considers the various-forms of education to be costbeneficial in its medicaid program . for example , in 1997 it implemented several-initiatives to educate new providers before they enroll in the texas medicaid program . first , each new medicaid provider receives a `` success with medicaid '' package containing-information on claim-filing , including helpful-tips , and instructions on how to use the automated-phone-system for inquiries . this `` welcome '' package is hand delivered during a site-visit by one of texas ' 19 medicaid field-representatives . three months after enrollment , the field-representatives evaluate a sample of each new provider 's claims to see if there are any issues that should be discussed . then , the same representative who made the initial-visit revisits the new provider to answer questions and discuss any problems noted in the claims-sample . in addition , program-personnel conduct various-workshops for and make educational-materials available to new providers . in another example , australia 's health insurance commission ( hic ) implemented a feedback-program to provide medical-practitioners with regular-information about their own benefit authorization , age and gender-patient-demographics , and comparative statistical-information showing the number of services rendered and dollar-value of benefits paid . all 32,000 practitioners receive correspondence once a year from hic . the program 's educational feedback encourages compliance and can act as a deterrent to future wrongdoing , as practitioners are aware that hic-tracks what is claimed for reimbursement on an annual basis . while , at first , most practitioners did not realize that hic was able to accumulate and analyze this information , the program has now become both an effective-deterrent and a desired source of information for the practitioners . for example , some practitioners have asked for additional information or statistics prior to the annual-feedback report . in october 1999 , the hic internet-feedback reporting facility was established to provide on-line-feedback and statistics to general-practitioners . about 2,100 general-practitioners accessed their feedback-reports on-line during 1999 , and hic implemented further enhancements to include feedback to other medical-practitioners . also in australia , centrelink has determined that 65 percent of its preventable incorrect-payments 13relate to incorrect-declaration of income by the customer or beneficiary . based on this risk-assessment , centrelink developed a range of specific-prevention-strategies aimed at educating-beneficiaries and employers on income-reporting requirements . these include ● educating the beneficiaries on the correct way to declare earnings and reminding them of the consequences of failing to correctly declare earnings and ● outreaching-employers in industries whose employees are traditionally more likely to receive improper-payments , such as those with seasonal or part-time-employees . in the latter-case , centrelink provides these employers with materials to distribute to existing and new employees who are receiving-benefits from centrelink . for example , to encourage accurate-income-reporting , the employers distribute `` payslips '' envelopes to employees for their use in storing their wage records . in addition to working-groups , coordination and cooperation with local-law-enforcement and other sources external to an agency can establish an infrastructure conducive to preventing and detecting-fraud . our case-illustration shows the value of such an centrelink defines all incorrect-payments as preventable unless the payment is unavoidable , such as legislated-advance-payments . furthermore , centrelink categorizes preventable-payments into three areas : preventable by the customer , preventable by staff , and preventable by the system . centrelink-reports $ 410 million to $ 460 million in incorrect-payments a year , of which 70 percent is classified as preventable-payments . infrastructure in preventing large-scale medicaid fraud perpetrators from receiving-payment for fraudulent-claims . effective-communications should occur in a broad-sense with information flowing down , across , and up the organization . in addition to internal-communications , management should ensure there are adequate-means of communicating with , and obtaining-information from , external-stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals . moreover , effective-information technology-management is critical to achieving useful , reliable , and continual-recording and communication of information . program-managers need operational and financial-data to monitor whether they are meeting their agencies ' strategic and annual-performance-plans and meeting their goals for accountability and effective-use of resources . monitoring-strategies are discussed in the next-section . strategies to consider-information and communications to effectively use and share-knowledge to manage improper-payments , the following-strategies should be considered : ● determine what information is needed by managers to meet and support-initiatives aimed at reducing improper-payments ; ● ensure that needed-information is provided to managers in an accurate and timely manner ; ● provide managers with timely-feedback on applicable performance-measures so they can use the information to effectively manage their programs ; ● develop educational-programs to assist program-participants in understanding-program-requirements ; ● ensure that there are adequate-means of communicating with , and obtaining-information from , external-stakeholders that may have a significant impact on improper-payment-initiatives , such as periodic-meetings with oversight-bodies ; and ● develop working-relationships with other organizations to share information and pursue potential-instances of fraud or other wrongdoing . monitoring : tracking the success of improvement-initiatives -we will want to know what action is being taken and what more could be done to get a grip on the burgeoning-levels of fraud and inaccuracy in benefit-claims . '' david davis , chairman of the parliamentary committee of public accounts , united kingdom monitoring-performance , over time , is critical to program-management and oversight . evaluation of an organization 's programs and its successes in meeting its established-goals and in identifying additional-actions is an integral-element of performance-measurement and continued-improvement in operations . monitoring focuses on the assessment of the quality of performance over time and on the prompt-resolution of problems identified either through separate-program-evaluations or audits . once an organization has identified its risks related to improper-payments and undertaken activities to reduce such risks by upgrading its control-activities , monitoring-performance allows the organization to gauge how well its efforts are working . in the united kingdom , the department for work and pensions ( dwp ) annually reviews its income-support and jobseeker 's allowance programs to estimate the level of fraud and error in the programs , measure progress toward meeting established performance-goals , and report-performance results to parliament . as a result of the program-monitoring and evaluation-activities these reviews permit , the government has set new , more challenging-targets for future performance . in addition , the national audit office ( nao ) in the united kingdom uses the review-results in its annual-audits of dwp's financial statements . nao reviews dwp 's sampling-methodology and sample-results , reviews some of the cases dwp examined , and selects its own sample to verify the accuracy of the reviews . the auditing-standards issued by the united kingdom 's audit practices board require nao to plan and perform its audits to provide for reasonable-assurance that the financial statements are `` free from material-misstatement , whether caused by error , or by fraud or other irregularity . '' further , her majesty 's treasury requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements on a cash-basis of all instances of significant-irregular-expenditures arising from erroneous-benefit-awards and fraud by claimants . after considering the results of dwp 's review and its evaluation of those results , nao qualified its fiscal year 1995 through fiscal year 2000 opinions on dwp 's financial statements because of the amount of fraud and error in the benefit-programs . nao has also provided constructive-advice on how dwp might improve its internal-control and risk-management-procedures . -the probability of review should never be zero . not for any provider , no matter how reputable ; nor for any claim , no matter how small . '' malcolm k. sparrow , license to steal ; why fraud plagues america 's health-care-system , 1996 illinois assessed the risk of improper-payments in its medicaid program , and , based on the results , implemented initiatives designed to improve payment-accuracy . to monitor the effects of the new initiatives , illinois will use random-claims sampling to test the accuracy of the payments by reviewing 150 randomly selected claims per month , or 1,800 per year . the goal of this project is to ensure that every paid claim faces an equal , random-chance of review . the judgment of field-staff , auditors , nurses , and policy-experts will be used to determine if they are paid correctly . this approach not only provides periodic-estimates of payment and service-accuracy-rates to help measure the results of existing enforcement and detection-efforts , but also helps deter future erroneous and fraudulent-billings . performance-measures are key to monitoring-progress in addressing improper-payments . new zealand requires entities from which the government purchases a significant-quantity of goods and services to include audited-statements of objectives and statements of service-performance with their financial statements . these statements include , where appropriate , performance-measures related to improper-payments . for example , performance-measures relating to entitlement-accuracy , services to reduce benefit-crime , and debt-management have been established for work and income new zealand ( winz ) , a government-agency that provides income-support and/or employment-assistance to eligible-people . winz 's financial statements are the main-accountability-reports used by parliament to monitor the agency 's performance . in addition , parliament uses the audited-information to make informed-decisions on resource-allocation , and , through a public-service monitoring body ( the state services commission ) , to hold the entity 's chief-executive-officer responsible if performance-standards are not met . for example , the government , in its role as purchaser , can offer rewards and apply sanctions to a chief-executive-officer to ensure performance . in addition , the government may seek to purchase goods and services from more than one source . winz 's monitoring of its payment-accuracy is discussed further in the case-illustration on the following-page . monitoring the activities used by an organization to address improper-payments should be performed continually and should be ingrained in the entity 's operations . ongoing-monitoring enables an organization to measure how well it is doing , track-performance measures , and adjust control-activities based on the results of monitoring-activities . the monitoring-process should also include policies and procedures for ensuring that the results of the reviews are communicated to the appropriate-individuals within the organization so that they can be promptly resolved . strategies to consider-monitoring to track the success of improvement-initiatives , the following-strategies should be considered : ● establish agency-specific-goals and measures for reducing improper-payments ; ● using-baseline-information for comparison , periodically monitor the progress in achieving the established-performance-measures ; ● make the results of performance-reviews widely-available to permit independent-evaluations of the success of efforts to reduce improper-payments ; ● ensure timely-resolution of problems identified by audits and other reviews ; and ● adjust control-activities , as necessary , based on the results of monitoring-activities . observations our study identified many techniques and approaches that organizations have used and found effective in reducing their levels of improper-payments that could be used by federal-agencies to help reduce improper-payments in their programs . the techniques and approaches shared a common-focus of improving the internal-control-systems over the problem-areas and generally included actions in five areas-control-environment , risk-assessment , control-activities , information and communications , and monitoring . our observations on the key-factors for successful-actions in each of these areas follow . in the area of control-environment , we found that , for improper-payment-initiatives to be successful , setting the tone at the top is critical . the pressures applied by top-management and oversight-entities are instrumental in clearly defining and communicating the need for improved program-operations and , most important , in redefining the organizational-culture . the goals and objectives of the initiatives being implemented must be transparent to all in the organization . without ongoing strong support , both in spirit and in action , of top-level-program-officials and legislative-bodies , the chances for success in implementing the changes needed to address improper-payments are slim . this top-level-support is especially-critical given that an investment of time and money is often needed in these types of efforts . one of the biggest hurdles that many entities face in the process of managing-improper-payments is overcoming the propensity toward denial of the problem . it is easy to rationalize avoiding or deferring taking-action to address a problem if you do not know how big the problem is . the nature and magnitude of the problem-determined through a systematic-risk-assessment process-needs to be determined and openly communicated to all relevant-parties . when this occurs , especially in a strong-control environment , denial is no longer an option , and managers have the information , as well as the incentive , to begin addressing improper-payments . this risk-assessment is used to determine where risks exist , what those risks are , and the potential or actual-impact of those risks on program-operations . as such , it helps identify the areas most in need of corrective-action and helps form a basis for determining how to allocate resources , human and monetary , to the problem-areas . by performing-risk-assessments on a recurring-basis , organizations also obtain information on the status of their efforts to reduce improper-payments and on areas needing further attention . in the area of control-activities , we found that organizations need to tailor their actions to fit their particular-needs . there is a wide-range of activities that can be used to effectively address improper-payments . these include the use of computer-assisted-activities ranging from simple comparative analyses ( e.g. , comparing-beneficiaries with mortality-rolls ) to the use of sophisticated-computer-models for interactive-analysis of large amounts of information ( e.g. , using neural-networking to identify suspicious-patterns of payments ) . regardless of the level of sophistication involved , the key to success is having the right-people perform the right-jobs . while these technology-based solutions can be expensive , such investments usually more than pay for themselves in terms of dollars saved . they also can be a significant-deterrent and provide for a level of program-integrity that could not otherwise be achieved . when obtaining , storing , and using-computer-generated information , an organization must always be mindful of privacy and security-issues . in the federal-arena , including federal-programs managed by state-organizations , computer-assisted-activities must be implemented consistent with all protections of the privacy act of 1974 , as amended by the computer-matching and privacy protection act of 1988 , and other privacy-statutes . we also found that organizations use both computer-generated information and nontechnical-methods to obtain , summarize , and communicate information needed to evaluate program-performance . whatever method is used , the flow of relevant , reliable , and timely-information regarding-performance should lead to improved-performance , particularly if an atmosphere of healthy-competition is introduced into the process . educational-activities for both beneficiaries and other program-participants also serve as an effective-communication-approach to help reduce improper-payments and strengthen program-operations . the better educated agency-employees , contractors , and beneficiaries are about what is expected of them and the consequences of not meeting those expectations , the greater the chances for reducing-fraud and errors in the payment-process . another key-point is that just putting-control-activities in place is not the end of the process-monitoring-progress and results is essential and must include the involvement of top-level officials . in addition to monitoring-day-to-day-performance , it is important for an organization to track-performance over time and measure it against established performance-goals or indicators . this monitoring-activity provides information on the effectiveness of the control-activities implemented and helps oversight and top-level-management-officials identify areas needing further attention or a shift in focus . high levels of improper-payments need not and should not be an accepted cost of running federal-programs . the organizations that participated in our study found they could effectively and efficiently manage improper-payments by ( 1 ) changing their organizations ' control-environments or cultures , ( 2 ) performing-risk-assessments , ( 3 ) implementing-activities to reduce fraud and errors , ( 4 ) providing relevant , reliable , and timely-information and communication of results to management , and ( 5 ) monitoring-performance over time . in the federal government , implementation of this process will likely not be easy or quick . it will require strong support , not just in words but in actions , from the president , the congress , top-level-administration-appointees , and agency-management officials . once committed to a plan of action , they must remain steadfast-supporters of the end-goals and their support must be transparent to all . further , there must be a willingness to dedicate the human-capital and monetary-resources needed to implement the changes . in the human-capital-area , this could involve performing-needs assessments and taking the actions necessary to hire individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to turn the planned-actions into reality . regarding-funding , many actions that proved successful to the organizations in our study involved computer-assisted-analyses of data . effectively and efficiently implementing some of these practices could require funding for computer-software and hardware , additional-staff , and/or training . in addition , it is important that the results of the actions taken be openly communicated or available not only to the congress and agency-management , but also to the general-public . this transparency demonstrates the importance that the government-places on the need for change and openly communicates-performance-results . it also acts as an incentive for agencies to be ever vigilant in their efforts to address the wasteful-spending that results from lapses in controls that lead to improper-payments . appendix i objectives , scope , and methodology the objectives of this study were to identify effective-practices and provide case-illustrations and other information for federal-agencies ' consideration when developing-strategies and planning and implementing-actions to manage improper-payments . in performing this study , we conducted extensive-research and identified three federal-agencies , three state-governments , three foreign-countries , and three private-sector-companies that took actions that they considered effective in reducing improper-payments in their programs . in general , for the organizations that participated in this study , we ( 1 ) conducted extensive-internet and literature-searches to identify actions that each had taken to reduce improper-payments , ( 2 ) made site-visits to interview representatives involved in identifying and taking-actions to reduce improper-payments , and ( 3 ) obtained and reviewed organization-reports and other documentation describing the actions taken , the results of those actions , and future plans in the area . as outlined below , we used several-techniques to identify the study-participants . federal-agencies we formed a focus-group within gao that was composed of program and financial-analysts familiar with each federal-agency . this group identified-agencies that had implemented practices to reduce improper-payments . additionally , we contacted the inspectors-general of the 24 chief financial-officers ( cfo ) act agencies to obtain their views on agency-activities , if any , designed to reduce improper-payments . once we identified potential-participants , we conducted extensive-internet-searches of their web sites and reviewed entity and gao audit-reports and other documents to obtain background and other information for potential best practice efforts . we then contacted three agencies , discussed our study objectives and planned-approach , and asked each if it had any programs in which actions to reduce improper-payments were effective . representatives at the three agencies ( the department of veterans affairs , the social-security administration , and the department of health and human-services ' centers for medicare and medicaid services ( formerly the health care financing administration ) identified-programs in which their organizations had taken actions considered effective and agreed to participate . state-governments we conducted extensive-internet-searches for all 50 states to identify reports and other studies that identified-states that had taken actions that appeared to identify and reduce improper-payments . we also coordinated with other gao representatives to identify states that had taken actions to reduce improper-payments in federal-programs in which program-management is a state responsibility , such as the food-stamp-program . based on the information obtained , we asked-representatives in the states of illinois , kentucky , and texas if they had any activities that they believed were effective in reducing improper-payments . each identified some actions and agreed to participate in the study . private-sector-organizations we contacted the private sector council , a public-service-organization that assists in the sharing of knowledge between the private and public-sectors . through this organization , three companies volunteered to participate in our study and supplied us with information on the techniques they used and considered effective in reducing improper-payments . foreign-governments our external liaison office contacted our counterparts in 12 countries and two world-organizations to explain our study objective and ask for input on activities , if any , each had taken to reduce improper-payments in its programs . we also conducted extensive-internet-searches to identify programs in each of these entities in which actions had been taken to reduce improper-payments . based on the responses from our initial-requests for information from the countries and organizations and our internet search-results , we selected three countries ( australia , new zealand , and the united kingdom ) as possible-study-participants . we contacted representatives for each , and they agreed to participate . in the course of identifying-actions that possible-participants in our study had taken to reduce improper-payments , we identified numerous web sites that might provide organizations with useful-information that they can consider when attempting to address improper-payment or other problems in their programs . appendix iii lists these resources . we conducted our fieldwork from may 2000 through march 2001 . we asked-officials of the various-organizations highlighted in the case-illustrations and throughout the report to verify the accuracy of the information presented on their activities and incorporated their comments as appropriate . we did not independently verify the accuracy of that information . in addition , we issued an exposure-draft of this executive-guide to obtain comments from interested parties including-members of the cfo and oig community , omb , and selected professional-organizations in the united states and abroad . we incorporated comments as appropriate . appendix ii entity-descriptions this appendix provides descriptions of the foreign governments' agencies and u.s. federal-agencies , state-governments , and private-sector-organizations that participated in this study . for our study , we contacted and visited various-people from the listed organizations who spent many hours-planning and hosting our visits , coordinating-meetings , and preparing and presenting-information . we thank them for their willingness to participate in our study , for the valuable-information and insights they provided , and for their hospitality . foreign-governments several-agencies responsible for delivering a variety of government-services in australia , new zealand , and the united kingdom participated in our study . the government-services provided by the agencies range from providing-audit-oversight and tax-collection activities to benefit administration and benefit-payments . australia the australian federation has a three-tier system of government , under the provisions of a written-constitution that includes the legislative , executive , and judicial-branches of government at both the national and state-levels . the division of powers between

. queen elizabeth ii of great britain is represented in new zealand by the governor-general . new zealand has no written-constitution but rather it has two documents of importance-the treaty of waitangi and the bill of rights act . much of the business of government is performed by ministries , government-departments , and other government agencies , which are collectively known as the public sector . inland revenue department the inland revenue department ( ird ) provides tax-services as well as social-policy-services , including the administration of child-support and family-assistance-programs and the collection of student-loan-repayments . ird revenues include $ 7 billion in individual-taxes , $ 3.76 billion in goods and services tax-revenue , and $ 1.85 billion

throughout the united kingdom . department for work and pensions the department for work and pensions ( formerly the department of social-security ) administers the united kingdom 's welfare-programs through four agencies-the benefits agency , child-support agency , war pensions agency , and appeals service agency . the benefits agency administers programs such as income-support and jobseeker's allowance-benefits . the benefits agency employs about 71,000 people and delivers more than 20 social-security-benefits , making-payments in excess of $ 156 billion each year . federal-agencies department of health and human services-centers for medicare and medicaid services the department of health and human-services ( hhs ) is the u.s. government 's principal-agency for protecting the health of all americans and providing essential human-services . in addition to the medicare and medicaid programs , the department includes more than 300 programs , covering a wide-spectrum of activity from medical-research , financial-assistance to low-income-families , to substance-abuse-treatment and prevention-programs . the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) ( formerly the health care financing administration ) , one of hhs ' operating-divisions , administers both the medicare and medicaid programs , which provide health care to about one in every four americans . medicaid medicaid , established in 1965 by title xix of the social-security act , is a federal-state matching entitlement program that pays for medical-assistance for certain vulnerable and needy-individuals and families with low-incomes and resources . in fiscal year 2000 , it provided health care assistance to an estimated 33 million persons , at a cost of about $ 118.6 billion to the federal government . cms is responsible for the overall-management of medicaid ; however , each state is responsible for managing its own program . within broad federal-statutory and regulatory-guidelines , each state ( 1 ) establishes its own eligibility-standards , ( 2 ) determines the types and ranges of services , ( 3 ) sets the rate of payment for services , and ( 4 ) administers its own program . medicare fee-for-service authorized by title xviii of the social-security act in 1965 , medicare is the nation 's largest health insurance-program handling more than 900 million claims per year on behalf of elderly and disabled-individuals at a cost of about $ 214.6 billion in fiscal year 2000 . fee-for-service-payments account for about $ 173.6 billion of medicare payments . cms contracts with over 50 insurance companies to process fee-for-service-claims ; however , cms is responsible for overseeing these contractors and for ensuring that claims are paid accurately and efficiently . social-security administration in 1935 , the social-security act established a program to help protect aged americans against the loss of income due to retirement . since that time , various-amendments were added , creating the programs that the social-security administration ( ssa ) administers today . established in 1994 as an independent-agency within the u.s. government , ssa is responsible for administering the old age and survivors-insurance ( oasi ) and disability insurance ( di ) programs as well as the supplemental-security-income ( ssi ) program . ssa 's organization-features centralized-management of the programs and a decentralized nationwide-network of 10 regional-offices overseeing 1,340 field-offices , 138-hearings-offices , 36 teleservice-centers , 7-processing-centers , and 1-data-operations center . oasi provides for the protection from loss of income for aged americans as well as survivors of deceased-workers . oasi had fiscal year 2000 outlays of about $ 347.9 billion , with about 39 million beneficiaries . di protects disabled-workers and their dependents from loss of income , and had fiscal year 2000 outlays of $ 54.2 billion , serving about 6.6 million beneficiaries . workers are considered disabled if they have severe physical or mental conditions that prevent them from engaging in substantial-gainful activity . ssi had outlays of $ 30.8 billion in fiscal year 2000 , providing-cash-assistance to about 6.6 million financially needy-individuals who are elderly , blind , or disabled . department of veterans affairs in 1930 , the congress consolidated and coordinated various veterans ' programs with the establishment of the veterans administration . it became a cabinet-level-position in march 1989-the department of veterans affairs ( va ) . va administers the laws providing-benefits and other services to veterans and their dependents and beneficiaries . through 21 organizations , including the veterans health administration and the veterans benefits administration , va ensures that veterans receive medical care , benefits , and social-support . major-programs of va include medical care , education , research , compensation , pension , education , and burial . in fiscal year 2000 , more than 3.8 million patients used va health care , over 2.6 million veterans and family members received monthly va disability compensation payments , and nearly 2.4 million graves were maintained at national-cemeteries . state-governments the state-agencies that participated in our study are responsible for administering a variety of benefit-programs in illinois , kentucky , and texas . state of illinois the illinois department of human-services ( idhs ) was created in 1997 by consolidating three human-services-agencies , one of which was the illinois department of public aid ( idpa ) , and parts of three others . idhs assumed the responsibility for administering cash-assistance , food-stamps , and medicaid eligibility-programs . however , idpa retains most of the responsibility for administering medicaid . idpa has an office of inspector-general ( oig ) that helps enforce policies and investigates misconduct in the medicaid , food-stamp , and welfare-programs administered by idpa and idhs . idpa oig includes a staff of 311 employees , and , in fiscal year 2000 , it operated under a budget of $ 19.6 million and collected or avoided costs totaling $ 38.3 million . according to preliminary fiscal year 2000 data , illinois ' food-stamp-program provided approximately $ 777 million in benefits to over 779,000 recipients . in fiscal year 1999 , illinois spent approximately $ 390 million of its temporary-assistance for needy-families ( tanf ) funds . in fiscal year 1998 , illinois spent approximately $ 6.2 billion for medicaid covering over 1.3 million recipients . commonwealth of kentucky kentucky 's cabinet for families and children protects and promotes the well being of kentuckians by delivering-quality-human services . it administers the state 's human-services-programs , such as food-stamps , foster-care , disability , and cash-assistance . meanwhile , the state 's cabinet for health services administers programs to promote mental and physical-health , emphasizing education and prevention . it administers medicaid through the department of medicaid services . according to preliminary fiscal year 2000 data , kentucky 's food-stamp-program provided approximately $ 337 million in benefits to over 403,000 recipients . in fiscal year 1999 , kentucky spent approximately $ 82 million of its tanf funds . in fiscal year 1998 , kentucky spent approximately $ 2.4 billion for medicaid covering over 644,000 recipients . state of texas texas has a number of departments involved in the administration of its medical and general-assistance-programs . its health and human-services commission ( hhsc ) , which provides overall-leadership and strategic-direction to the health and human-services-system in texas , oversees the work of 13-state-agencies , including the texas department of health ( tdh ) and the texas department of human-services ( tdhs ) . tdh administers more than 200 separate-programs and operational-units , including medicaid . this department has more than 5,500 employees and an annual-appropriation of approximately $ 6.5 billion . tdhs administers state and federal-human services-programs , including tanf and the food-stamp-program , to more than 2 million needy , elderly , or disabled texans each month . as one of the largest human-services-agencies in the country , tdhs employs more than 15,000 and has an annual-budget of $ 3.5 billion . according to fiscal year 2000 data , texas ' food-stamp-program provided approximately $ 1.2 billion in benefits to over 1.3 million recipients . in addition , texas spent approximately $ 228 million of its tanf funds in serving more than 300,000 recipients . in fiscal year 1998 , texas spent approximately $ 7.1 billion for medicaid covering over 2.3 million recipients . private-sector-companies private sector council the private sector council ( psc ) is a nonprofit , nonpartisan public-service-organization committed to assisting the federal government in improving its efficiency , management , and productivity . since its founding in 1983 , psc has continued to promote and further the notion that private sector `` know-how '' can , and should , be utilized to assist in solving public sector challenges by supplying federal-managers with modern-ideas , methodologies , and applications through over 300 projects . member-companies consist of prominent fortune 500 companies from across north america , including-telecommunications , defense , finance , and energy-businesses . psc assembled three volunteer-companies to participate in our study . these companies included a telecommunications-company with $ 33.6 billion in fiscal year 2000 sales , a document-management-company with $ 18.6 billion in fiscal year 2000 sales , and a consulting firm with $ 1.95 billion in revenues . appendix iii other
