towards a general postal-service cost function* robert cohen postal-rate commission carla pace poste italiane antónia rato ctt - correios de portugal matthew robinson postal-rate commission ricardo santos ctt - correios de portugal gennaro-scarfiglieri poste italiane vincenzo visco comandini poste italiane john waller postal-rate commission spyros xenakis postal-rate commission *the views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarilyrepresent the opinions of ctt - correios de portugal , poste italiane or the postal-ratecommission . 1 . introduction mailhandling-activities in the posts of industrial-countries are remarkably alike . each of the major-functions ( delivery , mail-processing , transportation , and window-service ) is conducted using similar-methods and technologies . therefore , it may be possible for a fairly simple-model to explain total and unit-cost-differences between posts . ideally , developing a cost-model for the 20 plus industrial-posts would involve collecting-data on many individual-cost-elements from each and using regression-analysis to estimate the coefficients of a cost-function . in today 's environment this is impossible because virtually all posts in industrial-countries consider much of their operational-cost-data to be commercially-sensitive and will not share them . in our previous-paper , cohen , et al . ( 2002 ) , we developed a model that related unit-costs to volume per capita . the model is based on u.s. costs . more specifically , it is based on the accrued cost of the major-functions and their cost-elasticities with respect to volume . a plot of that cost-function reveals the classic hyperbolic-shape with unit-costs increasing more rapidly as volume per capita-declines because of the loss of economies of scale . see figure 1 . in our previous-paper , we made adjustments to the model to allow for comparison with poste italiane . in particular , adjustments were made for differences in labor-cost , amount of worksharing , and mix of mail by shape.1 in this paper , we add an adjustment for counter costs.2 the resulting-model-estimate of poste italiane 's unit-cost is 74 cents versus the actual-value of 79 cents . it must be pointed out that the cost-model is used to estimate costs over an extreme range of volume . u.s. volume per capita in 1999 was 739 pieces while italy 's was 115 pieces per capita . given this range , the authors are encouraged by the relatively-small deviation of the estimate from actual . 1 see the appendix to cohen , et al . ( 2002 ) . 2 the usps has only 14 counters per 100,000 population , while poste italiane has 24 counters per 100,000 population . figure 1 : model estimates of unit-cost benchmarked by u.s. costs and volumes 2.50 2.00 cost per piece ( $ us ) 1.50 1.00 0.50 0.00 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 pieces per capita in this paper we examine the hypothesis that the cost-model provides reasonable-estimates of the unit-costs of other posts of industrialized countries.3 the hypothesis can not , however , be directly confirmed because we do not have sufficient-cost-data on other countries to compare with the model-results . we provide indirect confirming-evidence of the hypothesis , using the fact that the model implies that mail-processing and delivery-costs will comprise specific-percentages of total-costs at specific per capita-volume-levels . we have obtained the actual-percentages of mail-processing-costs and delivery-costs relative to total-costs for seven posts with which we compare the predicted percentages . although the evidence is not conclusive , it confirms the hypothesis . we first present our model for total-costs and unit-costs . we next present the test of our hypothesis by comparing the predicted percentages for each of the seven posts with the actual-percentages . we then produce a trend-line through the data-points and compare it with the model-results . finally , we compare actual unit-revenues , and some derived unit-costs , for the seven posts with the model 's prediction of unit-costs . the editors of the book in which our previous-paper [ cohen , et al . ( 2002 ) ] appears suggested that we examine the hypothesis that the cost-model accurately describes the costs of other posts . 2 . the cost-model the model is the same as that used by cohen , et al . ( 2001 ) except that we now present it as a generalized-cost-function . the model assumes that there are two primary-determinants of cost for a postal-system : volume and size of the network . for each activity a post performs , there are volume-driven attributable-costs and networkdriven institutional-costs . to create a total-cost-function , we use fy 1999 u.s . postal-service data to define the relationship between costs and cost-drivers . costs for each postal-activity ( mail-processing , delivery , etc ) that can be attributed to mail-volumes , are divided by total-volume to obtain an estimate of the marginal cost.4 the remaining-costs are institutional-costs that are primarily driven by the size of the network . population is a reasonable-proxy for the size of the network and therefore institutional-costs are divided by the u.s. population to obtain the additional-cost per person . this produces annual-cost-functions for each of the major postal-activities and a total-cost-function . since all costs are variable in the long run , it is reasonable that non-delivery institutional-costs would decline over the large-volume range we explore with this model . for purposes of this analysis we assume that 25 percent of non-delivery institutional-costs would be volume variable.5 no portion of delivery institutional-costs is considered to be volume-variable , however , because route-structure generally does not change as volume-drops . as long as coverage is relatively high , carriers will have to cover their entire-route . thus , fixed-delivery-costs would not be expected to drop until volume per capita were so low that the resulting very low-coverage allowed carriers to skip parts of their routes . 4 attributable-costs using the prc cost-treatment are greater than volume-variable costs . consequently , the estimate is slightly higher than the true marginal-cost . 5 the results are not very sensitive to this assumption as can be seen in cohen , et al . ( 2001 ) . the cost-function in u.s. dollars is : variable institutional mail-processing = 0.1032v + 2.10p delivery = 0.0525v + 42.24p transportation = 0.0200v + 0.92p window-service = 0.0092v + 4.64p all other costs = 0.0241v + 24.41p total-costs = 0.2089v + 74.31p where v = volume and p = population . it can be seen that the total-cost of providing postal-service in the u.s. for fy 1999 was 20.89 cents per piece plus $ 74.31 per person . the total-cost for other countries can be estimated by substituting-volume and population into the above formula . the total-cost-function can be used to estimate average-unit-cost by dividing the terms by v : average-unit-cost = 0.2089 + ( 74.31 p / v ) . this can be restated in terms of v / p , or pieces per capita ( ppc ) , as : average-unit-cost = 0.2089 + ( 74.31 / ppc ) . the percent of total-cost for each function included in the model and cost-elasticity ( with respect to volume ) are shown in table 1 . the model assumes constant-unit variable-costs . thus , when volume is reduced total variable-cost is reduced by the same percentage . at lower per capita-volumes , the ratio of fixed to variable-cost-increases and the cost-elasticities-decrease ( because a greater proportion of total-costs is fixed ) . similarly , the model assumes a constant-coefficient for population . table 1 : fy 1999 usps percent of total-cost and elasticity ( with respect to volume ) of the major a source : postal-rate commission docket r2000-1 b includes both in and out of office-activities . c does not include intra city transportation-costs . the u.s. cost-elasticities in table 1 , when applied to the accrued-costs of each function , determine the coefficients in the cost-function , which in turn generate the unique-shape of the unit-cost function ( figure 1 ) . further , these coefficients determine the percent of total-cost that comes from mail-processing and delivery at a specific-volume per capita . the total-cost for an individual-country can be expressed as a function of pieces per capita by rewriting the above basic-total cost-equation as : total-cost for country `` i '' = ( 0.2089 pi ) ( v/pi ) + 74.31 pi , where pi = population for country `` i '' , 0.2089pi = slope 74.31pi = intercept . the values of the slope ( rate of increase in total-costs ) and intercept ( institutional-costs ) are directly related to the population of the country . if country a has twice as many inhabitants as country b , then the slope and intercept of a's cost-function will be twice as large as the slope and intercept of b 's cost-function . figure 2 displays the total-cost-curves as functions of pieces per capita for each of the countries in the sample . the differences in slopes and intercepts reflect population-differences . if total-volume , instead of pieces per capita , were displayed on the vertical-axis , then the y-intercepts would remain unchanged but the cost-curves would be parallel . although figure 2 shows a family of total-costs-curves , figure 1 displays a single-unit cost-curve because the unit-cost-curve depends on only one variable , pieces per capita . figure 2 . total-cost functions for sampled posts not adjusted for structural-differences 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 pieces per capita 3 . adjustments to estimate the cost of a post using the model , it is necessary to take into account labor-cost-differences between the u.s . postal-service and the given post . the test of our hypothesis , however , does not involve predicting-unit-costs of other posts . it involves predicting the percentage of total-cost devoted to mail-processing and delivery . thus , labor costs do not need to be adjusted . the total-percentage of mail-processing-costs would have to be adjusted if worksharing , automation , or mail-mix had significantly-different impacts on mail-processing-costs . we have adjusted mail-processing-costs for la poste and posti finland . both france and finland include the costs of cancellation and mail-preparation in counter-costs . because the u.s . postal-service classifies these costs as part of mail-processing , we adjust the percentages of mail-processing-costs upward for france and finland to reflect a similar treatment . this has no effect on total-costs , and therefore only affects the mail-processing-percentage . the number of deliveries per week varies among the posts in the sample ( canada , finland , and portugal deliver five times per week , great britain delivers 12 times weekly in urban-areas and six in rural areas ) . consequently it is necessary to adjust the percentage of delivery-costs for these posts to the level it would be with six deliveries per week ( as in the u.s. ) when the percentage of delivery-cost is increased or decreased for a given post , the percentage of mail-processing-cost is decreased or increased accordingly.6 4 . confirming the hypothesis 4.1 data canada post , consignia ( royal mail ) , posti finland and la poste supplied the percentages of delivery and mail-processing-costs to us . the authors supplied the data for ctt correios de portugal and poste italiane . only la poste delivers unaddressed-mail separately from normal-mail . consequently , the volumes and percentages of total-cost for la poste do not include unaddressed-mail . unaddressed-mail is included in the calculations for other posts . the cost-percentages reflect labor and non-labor-costs , except for germany . the deutsche post percentages are derived from workforce full-time-equivalents contained in its annual report for fy 2001 and an internal post italiane-study on german-delivery operations developed in part from meetings with deutsche post management . the deutsche post annual report provides the total number of full-time-equivalents involved in postal-operations and the poste italiane document provides the number involved in delivery-operations . while this is a proxy for labor and non-labor-costs , it is considered realistic since in the u.s. , the use of workforce full-time-equivalents provide estimates within a few percentage points of those calculated with labor and non-labor-costs . 6 the population-density ( or more specifically the postal-density -- the average-time it takes to travel between addresses ) of a country has an impact on street-delivery-costs . ideally we could adjust for this if data were available . ( see bernard , et al . 2002 ) . 4.2 empirical-findings empirical-findings from the investigation are presented in figure 3 . the top line represents delivery-cost-percentage ( of total-cost ) as a function of pieces per capita as predicted by our cost-model . the bottom line represents the same for mail-processing-costs . figure 3 : functional-percentage of total-costs benchmarked by u.s. costs and volumes percentage of total-costs 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 pieces per capita with the exception of the lowest volume-post ( poste italiane ) the model 's predicted percentages are close to the actual-percentages for delivery . we think poste italiane , a very low-volume post , may have a somewhat lower percentage of delivery-costs than predicted owing to low-coverage on very low-volume-routes especially in rural areas . when carriers deliver to only a small number of stops on a route they tend to cover the route in a way more similar to a `` traveling-salesman '' than following a fixed-route past every stop . thus , there may be less fixed-costs on these routes than indicated by the elasticities embedded in the cost-model based on u.s. costs , which reflect very high coverage-levels . if this conjecture is correct , then italy 's delivery-percentages could be adjusted upwards ( by an unknown-amount ) towards the predicted value and their mail-processing-costs would then have to be adjusted downwards . a downward-adjustment would also improve italy 's relation to the mail-processing-prediction but move portugal further away . some of the deviation for italy and portugal may be due to the fact that they have proportionally much larger retail-operations involving-collection and acceptance than the u.s. and other posts . for example , portugal 's retail-post-office operations account for 21 percent of total-costs , while in the u.s. they account for approximately six percent . poste italiane also has a relatively-large percentage of costs in collection and acceptance , 15 percent . nevertheless , the authors can not explain why portugal 's percentage of mail-processing-cost is so low in comparison to the other posts in the sample . a significant-virtue of these curves is that they are independent of the price of labor . thus , by using this evaluation technique , we are able to avoid the need for obtaining productive hourly-costs translated into dollars using-purchasing-power parities . it appears that other factors , for which adjustments are not made , do not cause significant-differences . this could be because these factors do not vary significantly from the u.s. , do not drive costs significantly , or tend to cancel each other out . 4.3 trend-analysis the bold-lines in figure 4 display trend curves for the actual processing and delivery-cost percentages from the test countries.7 these curves were generated using excel . they have virtually the same shape as the curves predicted by the model and further confirm the fit between the model and the data . the low-delivery-cost percentage of the low-volume per capita-country , italy , pulls the delivery-trend-line down away from the predicted line . the fact that the actual mail-processing-percentages for italy and portugal are about equidistant below and above the predicted values-causes the mail-processing trend-line to match the model-line at low-volumes despite relatively-large errors . these disparities at low-volumes between the trend and model-lines reinforce our belief that the model is less useful in predicting-costs for low per capita-volume-posts than it is for medium to high volume per capita-posts . it is to be expected that the accuracy of predictions will diminish as the range over which the predictions are made increases . these trend-lines were selected because they best-fit the data . for delivery-percentages , the trend-line is y=46.943e-0.0004x with an r2 of 0.78 . for mail-processing-percentages the trend-line is y=10.869ln ( x ) - 38.407 with an r2 of 0.69 . figure 4 : functional-percentage of total-costs with regression curves 70 60 percentage of total-costs 50 40 30 20 10 0 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 pieces per capita 5 . estimated-unit-costs in order to compare unit-costs , it is desirable to make the adjustments we have discussed above plus an adjustment for productive hourly-wage in purchasing-power-parities ( ppp ) . data for these adjustments were not available , except for italy . the u.s. values used in making-adjustments for poste italiane data are listed in the appendix . in the absence of actual-cost-data , we compare model-cost-results to actual-revenues . for the posts in our sample we have used the model to estimate unit-costs and adjusted only for deliveries per week ( canada , finland , u.k. , and portugal . ) in table 2 , we compare these estimates with average-revenue per piece converted to u.s. cents using oecd 's ppp for 1999 . table 2 : comparison of model estimated coststo actual revenue per piece for 1999 ( u.s. cents ) model cost revenue estimates per piecea canada 43 41 finland 34 39 france 38b 40b germany 50 57 italy 90 79c portugal 62 54 u.k. 46 50 u.s. 31c a from annual-reports and posts of authors , 2000 for portugal b includes unaddressed-mail c actual-cost per piece the largest discrepancy appears to be italy . we know , however , that the post italiane productive hourly-wage is three quarters of that of the u.s . postal-service . as stated in the introduction , when we adjust for italian-labor-costs , worksharing , mail-mix , and number of counters , we get a modeled unit-cost of 74 cents . 6 . conclusions the principal-conclusion is that empirical-evidence-corroborates the validity of this model because the predicted functional percentages of costs are reasonably-close to actual-values . see figure 3 . in particular , the general-shape of the unit-cost-curve ( with respect to per capita-volume ) appears to be valid for the posts of industrialized-countries sampled . see figure 1 . the model , however , is a more accurate-predictor of the cost-behavior of medium to large per capita-volume-posts than for small per capita-volume-posts . the model also demonstrates that both volume and population are important explanatory-factors of postal-costs . clearly , additional-research is warranted . regulators and operators in any industrialized-country are encouraged to use the data in the appendix on u.s. cost-characteristics to make adjustments to the model and determine if the model-forecasts-costs with reasonable-accuracy . of course , we would not expect exact correspondence even after adjustments are made owing to differences in efficiency and service-quality . appendix : fy 1999 usps operational statistics • productive hourly-wage : $ 23.87644 • mail-mix by shape : 72-percent-letters and cards , 26 percent-flats , 1-percent-parcels • percentage of mail with some worksharing : 72 • percentage of letters barcoded by mailers : 56 • percentage of letters barcoded by usps : 32 • percentage of flats barcoded by mailers : 38 • percentage of mail not delivered ( i.e . post-office-box mail ) : 21.4 • average postal-density ( addresses per fixed street-hour ) : 100.5 • counter-costs : 5.6 percent references bernard , stephane , robert cohen , matthew robinson , bernard roy , jöelle toledano , john waller , and spyros xenakis . 2002 . `` delivery-cost-heterogeneity and vulnerability .
