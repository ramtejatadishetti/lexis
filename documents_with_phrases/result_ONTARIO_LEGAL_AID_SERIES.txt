presentation of randi youells , lsc vice-president for programs for the ontario legal-aid speaker series thank you for inviting me to your wonderful-country and the beautiful-city of toronto to talk with you about the subject that has been the primary-focus of my professional-life over the last twenty-seven years-the-provision of high quality legal-services to people who could not otherwise afford legal-aid . as did many of you in this room , i started my legal-aid-journey fresh out of law-school in 1975 . as i was sworn in as a licensed-attorney in the state of iowa-which is a small rural-farming-state located in the midwestern-part of our country-i optimistically and mistakenly believed that my `` life in legal-services '' would be a short one . i truly believed that in my lifetime i would witness the eradication of poverty and injustice . i believed that i would see the day when no person-be they american or canadian-would go hungry at night . i believed to the very core of my soul that the human-race was on the brink of a new era in which intolerance and bigotry and prejudice would no longer exist . but as we all know today that young-women who started her life in legal-services in 1975 full of hope and promise-and just a wee-bit naïve-was not correct about what the future would hold . today , in the offices of the legal-services corporation of iowa young-attorneys are providing legal-assistance to the children and the grandchildren of the clients i tried to help 27 years ago . today , in our country , hundreds of thousands of people live in our streets . today , millions of children go to bed hungry at night . today , just like 27 years ago , racial and ethnic-bigotry remains the central-reality of most of our clients ' lives . today-just like yesterday-thousands of people daily-knock on the door of legal-services and they are told , `` no one is home . and that is the reality that brings us here on this beautiful september day . because we are older and wiser-and perhaps more damaged and more battle-scarred-we know that the promise of legal-services has not been fulfilled . but perhaps because within all of us there continues to live younger more idealistic lawyers-a-whisper of the lawyers we were at the beginning of our professional-lives-we are here today because we are not ready to let go of the `` promise '' of legal-services . we are not ready to call it quits . we are not ready to stop believing that we can build a world-class legal-services-delivery system in both of our countries . that 's what i will speak to you about today . although most of my remarks will be devoted to the steps we have undertook within my country to revitalize a struggling legal-services-delivery system-steps that we often colloquially refer to as state planning-state-planning has always been for me but a tool . the overarching-goal has always been-and will always be-the-creation of world-class legal-services-delivery systems in which no client or potential-client is turned away . after all , in a democracy , the halls of justice must always stand wide-open and everyone must be welcome to walk through them unimpeded and unchallenged . let 's start with a history-lesson . legal-services-programs in the united states began in the 1960 's as special-model-projects initiated by the federal government 's office of economic opportunity . they were infused with the idealism and spirit of the kennedy years and strengthened by president johnson 's vision of a great society . under president nixon , who signed the legal-services act of 1974 , they became an institution and , over time , a familiar part of the legal-landscape in every u.s. state and territory . until very , very recently , lsc-programs were organized and operated pretty much as they had a quarter of a century ago . they were locally focused and passionately promoted `` local-control . '' many of the staff made legal-services their careers . some of the programs ' managers stayed with one program for their entire professional-lifetimes . in some programs , board-membership terminated only with the member 's death . the kinds of cases handled , the strategies for addressing the legal-needs of service-area residents , and the client-community itself remained pretty much the same in most lsc-programs until the 1990 's . and , while the idealism and vision of a new world remained-part of our mantra , its place of honor receded , as legal-services became-business as usual for many grantees . several-events in the mid-1990 's brought an end to this way of life for the legal-services-community in my country . the congress , which controls our funding-levels , began to include many members who did not support the purpose and goals of a federal civil legal-services-program . consequently , funding-appropriations diminished or failed to keep up with the cost of living . then , in the middle of the decade , a vigorous-effort to do away with legal-services resulted in a funding-bill that carried significant-restrictions , including one that prohibited-programs from seeking attorney's fees . additional-restrictions prevented our grantees from doing much of the work they had previously handled-representing-prisoners in civil-litigation , representing certain-groups of immigrants , representing-clients in class-action-lawsuits . the congress also told lsc that it could not continue to fund its grantees '' presumptively '' and that it must begin to distribute its funds on a competitive-basis . this union of significant-funding-declines , restrictions and competition began to inexorably change the way that legal-services in the united states operate . as a funder and as an organization concerned with seeing that low-income-people who struggle with critical civil legal emergencies such as evictions and domestic-violence , have access to the justice-system , lsc was not willing to accept the `` guide-path to oblivion '' that some had designed for our future . in 1997 , lsc began to initiate a series of efforts that we believed would ensure that services to clients did not falter in a time of decreasing resources and limited-opportunities . needless to say , most of 'the field , ' as we refer to the collective-entity that constitutes our grantee-programs , was already frightened and concerned because of the funding drops , new restrictions and competition-fears . when , in 1998 , lsc announced its intent to launch an initiative that would require massive-restructuring of the national legal-services-delivery system , the announcement was also quite-frightening and was not greeted , in many quarters , with open-arms . so , what has lsc done to restructure the american legal-services-delivery system since 1998 ? the most innovative and certainly the most difficult-part of our strategy to move our grantees into new approaches to serving-clients-and the one that has received the most attention ( both good and bad ) -is the state-planning strategy that we launched in 1998 . as it was conceived and as it has played out , lsc 's state-planning-initiative is a new visioni for legal-services in which eligible-clients in every state are afforded an equal-opportunity to avail themselves and ultimately to attain high-quality civil legal-assistance . in an effort to foster more consistent-levels of statewide-service and to eliminate `` service-gaps '' that leave clients in geographically remote-areas underrepresented compared to their urban-counterparts , lsc has asked each of its grantees to undergo a fundamental-paradigm-shift in their program-vision . program-leaders have been instructed to abandon the parochial-thinking of `` what 's best for clients in my service-area ? '' and asked instead to consider `` what's best for clients throughout my state ? '' and ultimately , `` what 's best for clients throughout the united states '' . i think that it is important for you to know that lsc initially stressed the importance of state-planning in 1995 when it asked its recipients in each state to participate in the development of a plan for the design , configuration , and operation of lsc-funded-programs in their states . the 1995 program lettersii were primarily developed it response to funding-cuts and restrictions that had crippled legal-services in our country . these early-planning documents laid the foundation for what was to come in 1998 in that they began to set forth a vision for legal-services-delivery and enumerated the issues and criteria that state-planning should address . however , except for a handful of states , the 1995 calls for state-planning were largely ignored and to be honest-lsc did little during this time period to promote nationwide-strategic planning . in 1998 , the state-planning-initiative was re-initiated . lsc program-letters 1998-1iii and 1998-6iv directed-programs to plan for the creation of comprehensive , integrated , coordinated legal-services-systems and defined the terms of such systems . grantees were required to submit a report outlining their state-plans by october 1 , 1998 . their plans were to include responses to the seven initial central-tenets of state-planning : ( 1 ) development of intake , advice , and referral-services ; ( 2 ) effective-usage of technology ; ( 3 ) increased-access to legal self-help and prevention-information ; ( 4 ) coordination of legal-work , training , information , and expert-assistance ; ( 5 ) engagement of pro-bono attorneys ; ( 6 ) development of additional-state , local , and private-resources ; and ( 7 ) optimal-configuration of service-areas . lsc did not confine its `` directives '' to what a plan should include . it also laid out the parameters of the planning-process itself . lsc instructed its grantee-programs to collaborate with a range of local , state , and national-stakeholders , including-state and local-bar-associations , interest on lawyers trust-account ( iolta ) administrators , state-judiciaries , client-groups , pro-bono commissions , state-legislatures , non-lsc-funded legal-services-programs , and a host of others . lsc required its grantees in each state to work with each other and with other equal-justice-stakeholders to develop justice-communities that best respond to clients ' most compelling-needs , ensure the most strategic and cost-effective-use of all available-resources , and maximize the opportunity for clients statewide to receive timely , effective , and appropriate legal-services . in 1999 , guided by the belief that access to quality legal-services is critical to a fair adversarial-justice-system and committed to making significant-improvements in the delivery-system-the lsc board of directorsv approved and enacted its own strategic plan-strategic-directions 2000-2005-which was adopted in january 2000 . the twin-objectives of strategic-directions 2000-2005 were to dramatically increase the number of low-income americans who can access the civil-justice-system and to ensure that all clients receive quality legal-services . strategic-directions 2000-2005 was developed as a forward-looking-document . it reinforced the state-planning-initiative already in place by calling-state planning its '' most important-strategy '' . in 1998 , lsc 's goal-a-goal shared by many of our partners in the american equal-justice-movement like the american bar-association and the national legal-aid and defender association-was to obtain a critical-mass of new ideas , funds and partners into the national legal-services-community , and to assist thousands of clients who were being denied-access to civil-justice because funding was diminished , because programs were failing to keep up with technological and other innovations , and because many of our grantees worked in isolation within states and across state-lines . this was a tremendous-change for our grantees and for the delivery-system that we funded . however , the state-planning-initiative was also a big-change ( as some would say , a huge-paradigm-shift ) for lsc as an organization . for years lsc had defined itself by the very traditional-roles of funder and regulatory-agency . the state-planning-initiative required lsc to become something different , transforming itself into an agent of change and an equity-partner capable of effecting large-scale-reformation in a moribund-delivery system . and , as any one versed in organizational-psychology or even experienced in managing a large-organization knows , such transformations do not come easy , they are seldom-painless , and they require the staff of the organization leading such a transformation to put themselves on the line in ways that often are unfamiliar and unpleasant . lsc was no exception and , today , within the walls of lsc you will find employees who still do not understand or support the state-planning-initiative . indeed , in recent internal-budget-battles within lsc , projects essential to the creation of world-class delivery systems- such as the development of a new measurement-system to measure our work and the work of our grantees in terms of outcomes for clients and projects to ensure that the delivery-system is inclusive and multi-culturally competent-were summarily removed from the first drafts of the budget by the staff who prepare the budget . funding for these projects was ultimately restored , but not without the intervention of the lsc president and the board of directors . and even today , some staff-including-staff that work for me-at times mention that they do not support lsc 's state-planning-initiative and believe that our state-planning-work is beyond our central mission . fortunately , many other staff do not see it in the same way . the creation of a world-class-delivery-system involved more than '' state-planning '' , per se . lsc also launched-companion initiatives-the-quality-initiative , the diversity-initiative , technology-initiative-grants , to name just a few -that worked hand-in-glove with state-planning to promote the development of high-quality-delivery-systems . one of the most important-companion projects was and continues to be competition . at the same time that lsc was launching its state-planning-initiative , congress required lsc to cease funding its grantees `` presumptively '' and to begin to fund-programs on a competitive-basis . today , lsc has been providing funding on a competitive-basis for seven years . in reality , there has been very little-actual `` competition '' for our federal-funds . there are many reasons for this lack of `` real-competition . '' first and probably foremost , as we all know , providing-high-quality legal-services to low-income-persons is not as easy as it looks . it requires systems and practices and mindsets and commitments that may be foreign to many other non-profit-providers of human-services . moreover , the fact that congress has placed numerous restrictions on legal-services-funding in the united states-restrictions that then attach to non-lsc funds-causes many organizations that might otherwise seriously consider applying for lsc-funds to choose not to do so . however , the fact that the competition-process has not resulted in widespread `` competition '' for funding does not mean that it has not been successful . indeed , i feel that the competition-process has been successful in ways that i would not have ever envisioned when i was hanging out in legal-services-programs in iowa and new jersey in the seventies , eighties and nineties . why ? because the first step in setting up a system of competition was to develop standards and benchmarks that we would use to evaluate programs and assess applicants' eligibility . and this was an important-and perhaps in american legal-services-quite revolutionary-development . the fact that benchmarks exist means that there is a standard that all grantees must meet before they are funded by lsc . it means that lsc has a regular-means of gathering important-qualitative and quantitative-information on all our grantees against which we can evaluate their services and their improvement . but it also means that there are aspirational-goals for `` perfection '' that define a high-quality legal-services-program . we have found that many of our grantees work hard to attain those aspirational-goals . competition was designed to improve quality . and i think that will be its lasting legacy ; the fact that is has improved-quality over the last seven years and it will continue to do so . each year the legal-services-delivery system in the united states gets better at the business of competition as lsc refines and improves the process and as our grantees , individually and collectively , become the kinds of high-quality legal-services-programs of which we can all be proud . competition , in and of itself , is now a major-tool used by lsc to develop a worldclass-delivery-system . we use it to push our grantees toward stronger and more aggressive-delivery of services to clients . it allows us to create more forceful-means of conditioning our grants . it allows us to measure program-performance in more sophisticated-ways . but linking-competition to state-planning has expanded the impact of both of these initiatives in powerful-ways that we were not able to envision in 1998 . let me explain . when an applicant seeks federal-funding from lsc and as they become grantees , they are required , as a condition of continued federal-funding , to pursue state-planning with all other lsc-funded-grantees , the penultimate-goals is the establishment of '' communities of justice '' in every state . the core-elements of the planning/competition link are as follows : • grantees must commit to not only providing-quality legal-services within their service-area but also to working with other legal-services-providers to develop a comprehensive , coordinated , integrated-delivery-system ; • grantees must commit to join with other equal-justice-stakeholders to establish statewide-delivery-systems capable-aspirationally-of serving every eligible-client in a state , despite geographic , cultural and physical-barriers that exist ; • grantees must commit to utilizing new technologies , self-help-materials , new intake-systems and multi-cultural-staff to reach underserved-clients ; • grantees must prove to lsc that their service-area boundaries are as relevant to clients and their communities as when they were first `` drawn '' or they must work together and with us to redraw them ; • grantees must work collaboratively with groups and organizations they may have historically considered to be competitors for scarce-funds ( such as other nonprofit-human and social-services-agencies and non-lsc funded legal-services-programs ) or unlikely-partners ( judges , legislators , bar-leaders ) ; • grantees must leverage additional-resources to expand services to lowincome-person ; and • here 's the kicker-grantees must do all of this or risk the loss of their federal-funding . as i noted earlier , the state-planning-initiative was a huge shift in thinking for the legal-services-community . but initially , most grantees thought that like many other projects begun by lsc , they only had to wait it out and it too would disappear into the ozone or ethernet or wherever legal-services-ideas go to find their eternal-rest . but lsc quickly began to prove we were serious about planning . we highlighted-model-systems in our literature and program-visits . at lsc board meetings , local-events and national-conferences , we showcased exemplary-planning and implementation . we developed technical-assistance-funds for creative-planning-projects and obtained a $ 15.6 million commitment from congress to underwrite sophisticated-hardware , web-based and telephonic-systems to expand services for clients . internally , lsc staff worked aggressively to calibrate-units within the programs division so that every programmatic-effort advanced the creation of high-quality-delivery-systems . for example , grant-award-decisions and visits to assess program-quality also focused on the efficacy of statewide-systems and collaborative-efforts with other agencies serving the client-community . as a result , over time , and with much-gnashing of teeth the `` elephant did begin to dance '' and lsc , its grantees and the federally-funded legal-services-delivery system began to evolve from a piecemeal , great society experiment to carefully chosen nonprofit-corporations working together to serve poor-clients in every jurisdiction . the most enduring-legacy of the state-planning-initiative-at least in terms of its first four years-has probably has been its success in fostering-cooperation among stakeholders . in 1998 , 10 states had designated state-planning-bodies dedicated to strengthening legal-services . today , 36 states have such bodies ; most others are in the midst of creating one . an essential-function of these bodies is establishing public-private-coalitions to maximize grantees ' ability to leverage their federal-investment . for example , last year in 2001 , the engagement of judges , legislators and private-bar-members helped spawn appropriations for legal-services in 25 states totaling $ 68.5 million - almost three times more than states appropriated in 1997 . meanwhile , private-bar campaigns quadrupled their fundraising from $ 5.3 million in 1997 to $ 23.6 million in 2001 . ten years ago when i was a legal-services-program director in iowa , the private-bar was either our adversary or a somewhat disfavored cousin in the family of legal-services . just like families with unsavory-family-members , legal-services-programs tolerated the presence of private-lawyers in our pro-bono models of delivery because we had to-not because we thought they were doing anything useful . today , in most parts of our country , the partnerships between legal-services-programs and the private-bar are deep and true . private-lawyers have an enhanced understanding of the importance of our work . we , in turn , understand the vital-role they play in helping to assure that no client goes unserved . ten years ago , a judge was someone you saw behind the bench when you went to court . today , judges from all levels , including-chief justices of state supreme courts , speak out about the need for quality legal-services for poor americans and work with us to try to respond to the problems that are being presented to the united states justice-system as a whole as the number of self-represented-litigants grows exponentially . state-planning also has improved-access for the fastest-growing client-subgroup : non-english-speakers . over the last-several years lsc has partnered with other associations like the african-american project-directors association to promote inclusion and multi-cultural-competency . today , legal-services-advocates are increasingly-bilingual ; 22 percent of employees at lsc-funded-programs in my country speak more than one language . in addition , self-help , multilingual-computer-kiosks have overcome language-barriers to help native americans living on reservations - and vietnamese and spanish-immigrants in california - enforce their legal-rights without knowing a word of english . and i personally believe that the quality and effectiveness of advocacy also has improved over the last four years . the `` prime directives '' of state-planning emphasize quality , training , holistic legal-services and cross-program-advocacy , and lsc and its grantees have paid increasing-attention to the quality of the services we provide to our clients . how does this relate to canada and , specifically , the initiative you propose to launch to address-issues that trouble your legal-services-system ? legal-services-programs in canada are about the same age as ours , and serve a similar-client-community . you face , just like us , certain-problems : • insufficient-funding ; • outmoded-delivery-system ; • changes in client-community ; • changes in the law ; • technological-changes ; and • the need to prepare for the future . these are pretty serious-problems . at times , they even appear insurmountable . but that does n't mean that we should n't try to address them in a proactive and `` straight-on '' manner . so i am going to conclude my remarks-today by offering you some guidance as you give thought to launching your own planning-initiative . consider them my personal-lessons from six years in the planning trenches : first , although our state-planning-initiative is highly replicable for any organization trying to effect rapid-change across a large and entrenched-culture of individual-programs or offices , such change is only possible if you are willing to be inclusive and collaborative in setting-goals and processes , yet firm and resolute in their ultimate-enforcement . second , it is going to require massive-change not only among your providers in the field but within your own organization ( s ) . historically , lsc directives were seen by grantees as antithetical to their mission , so they resisted-change while nonetheless remaining largely-dependent on the waning federal-investment . in order to overcome this obstacle we had to change the way we did business . we ramped up lsc 's profile by visiting-programs and participating in local-meetings and national-conferences to relay our message , hear reactions and improve relationships . and this same consistent-message was repeated over and over again by key lsc staff wherever they traveled-including the president , the other vice-presidents , and the staff on the ground who were guiding states through the planning-process . you will have to be willing to do the same . you will need-all of you will need-to be highly-visible personally and professionally . and you must recognize and accept that doing so will take inordinate-amounts of your time and your energy . third , you will-let me repeat that loudly and firmly-you will face-resistance . any effort to change a long-established-system will meet resistance . that is inevitable . however , the good news is that you can slowly overcome this resistance over time . but time-and-timing-will be crucial . it won't happen overnight and it wo n't happen without some setbacks . we failed when we pushed willing , but unprepared-grantees to opportunities they were not ready to exploit . we also suffered more than was necessary by not including willing-grantees and other equal-justice-stakeholders early on as our partners in the process of effectuating-change . we did n't realize how long it was going to take before we would begin to see some successes . and then we failed to celebrate those successes as important-milestones and victories . so , expect resistance . commit to the long haul . and celebrate your intermediary-successes along the journey . fourth , tie-planning to quality early on and stick with it . planning is not an end . it is a means to an end and you must clearly and consistently articulate the `` end '' that you envision . talk-quality all of the time . vigorously promote those legal-services-programs that provide high-quality legal-assistance holding them out as programs-others should emulate . establish and share `` best-practices . '' be willing to stick your neck out and hold conferences and meetings on quality-issues of interest to the legal-services communities . in the last-several years , lsc has hosted numerous-conferences where advocates can share ideas , such as diversity in the legal-services-community , making-mergers-work , and creating client-centered-communities of justice . had we had more money we would have facilitated more conferences . they are an important-mechanism to bring people together to find-and define-common-ground fifth , put your money where your mouth is . set aside-money specifically for planning . since 1999 , lsc has awarded more than $ 800,000 in technical-assistance-funds for state-planning projects . and although we could have used lots more , this small-sum did allow us to publicly recognize high-performers and promote planning models for others to emulate . but money is important for another reason . planning has `` costs '' and you need to be seen as an organization that understands those costs and is willing to help grantees and other stakeholders with some of the planning costs . sixth-familiarize yourself with sol alinksy 's rules for radicals . not because you are going to use it . but because mr. alinksy lays out what you can personally expect to happen to you if you are in the forefront of this initiative . mr. alinksy instructs his readers to pick an issue , find an adversary and make it personal . and that may be you- at the wrong-end of the personal attacks . so get psychologically-prepared and do n't be blind-sided by the venom . although your journey is going to be difficult and at times you will doubt yourselves , the benefits to clients are well worth it and the satisfaction of hearing even the most recalcitrant of adversaries say that the new system is better than the one that went before is deeply-rewarding . and remember what your grandmother probably said to you a long time ago-what does n't kill you probably makes you stronger . seventh-do n't ignore the need to promote the value of planning internally among all of your staff . one of the most stupid-errors that lsc made as we kicked off an era of planning was not to take the time-and expend the energy-to make other offices and units within our own organization understand the importance of what we were doing and their vital-role in helping promote and develop world-class-delivery-systems . this set up needless-competition for scarce-resources and created hurt-feelings among some staff . and , finally-keep your eye on the prize . remember the person who first decided to go to law-school , think about that young excited lawyer starting his/her first job , remember the neophyte-attorney newly admitted to the practice of law who was excited , scared and enthralled about the future . we all cared deeply about justice when we started this journey . and we care deeply about it today or we would n't be here together in this room . we will settle for nothing less than a world-class-delivery-system . and although we are a little older and slightly grayer and certainly more jaded , and we know now that we wo n't see it happen in our lifetimes , we still believe-i still believe-that our collective-dream of a justice-system that lets client walk through the doors of justice unimpeded and unshackled , is a dream that we will achieve . one day . together . here in canada . and in the united states . thank you again for allowing me to be with you today . i twenty-five-years ago , our government made a pledge to help ensure that all persons have access to america 's civil-justice-system by enacting-legislation that created legal-services corporation . over the past 27 years , lsc has helped millions of low-income-citizens solve important , sometimes-life-threatening , civil legal-problems . despite the success of lsc and its many contributions to access to justice for lowincome americans , its achievements are overshadowed by the fact that so many in our society continue to suffer injustice and are unable to gain access to a lawyer for critical legal-assistance . until all members of our society are afforded that access , this promise of our government will continue to be unfulfilled . lsc is committed to promoting a new vision of legal-services that will achieve the goal of bringing legal-services to those currently denied-access to the justice-system . ii program-letter 1995-1 directed lsc-recipients to develop plans to stretch scarce federal-dollars in the most effective , efficient-ways possible . the letter also anticipated the passage of congressional-restrictions on the activities of lsc-programs , prompting lsc to instruct its programs to forge deeper bonds with other stakeholders , including non-lsc-funded-programs , state and local-bar-associations , iolta administrators , the judiciary , and client-groups . program-letter 1995-4 provided a general-outline as to the issues and criteria that the state-planning-process should address . significant-emphasis was placed on the integration of lsc-funded-programs into statewide-legal services-delivery-systems and the seven central-tenets of state-planning were identified . iii program-letter 1998-1 , published on february 12 , 1998 , called upon all lsc-recipients to analyze any progress made toward the development of the legal-services-model envisioned by state-planners . programs were to evaluate whether all programs were working cohesively to assure that urgent-clients-needs were being addressed ; whether sufficient-capacities for training and information-sharing existed ; whether programs were moving forward on technology ; and whether they were collaborating to increase resources and develop new initiatives to expand the scope of their services . grantees were also asked to examine whether the existing-program-configuration was conducive to the most effective-state delivery-system . grantees were asked to examine their progress in each of the seven principal-areas of state-planning in a manner that included assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the current-approach , establishing-goals to strengthen and expand services to eligible-clients , and determining the major-steps yet to be taken and a timetable necessary to achieve those goals . lsc set a deadline of october 1 , 1998 , for submission of state-planning-reports . iv program-letter 1998-6 , published on july 6 , 1998 , responded to recipient-requests for guidance and additional information on what was expected in their state-planning-reports . it included '' state-planning considerations '' designed to address requests for additional information regarding statewide-goals , capacities , and approaches-recipients should consider in their state-planning-processes . program-letter 1998-6 stated that the state-planning-initiative will provide information to aid lsc in exercising its statutory-responsibility to `` insure that grants and contracts are made so as to provide the most economical and effective-delivery of legal-assistance to persons in both urban and rural areas . '' v lsc is headed by an 11-member board of directors , appointed by the president , and confirmed by the senate . by law , the board is bipartisan and no more than six members may be of the same political-party .
