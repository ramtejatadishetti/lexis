First, we consider the top 391 words and find their embeddings by averaging the word embeddings of the underlaying words. 
Spelling mistakes were corrected as well. 
Then we cluster them manually into 24 clusters. Multiple instances of the same word are considered separately. 
Clustering methods used: Gaussian and KMeans

Evaluation criterion: Purity of clusters

According to purity, scoring for all clusters is between 48 and 52.
